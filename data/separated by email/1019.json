Further more your area of\r\nspecialization will not be a hindrance to the\r\nsuccessful completion of this transaction. I have\r\nreposed my confidence in you and hope you will not\r\ndisappoint me. Should you be willing to assist\r\npositively with a common goal, endeavor to contact\r\nme immediately through my above email address.\r\nIf you are not interested, please also indicate so\r\nthat it will enable me to contact other foreign\r\npartner with recommendations to carry out this deal.\r\nI want to assure you that my colleagues and I are in\r\nposition to make the payment of this claim possible\r\nprovided that you can give us a very concrete\r\nassurance of the safety of our share.
