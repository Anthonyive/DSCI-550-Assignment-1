ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.\r\nIt may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's\r\nAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by\r\nnon-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.\r\nThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons\r\n(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant\r\naccounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.\r\n\r\nThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including\r\ninterest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit\r\nboxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.\r\nNumbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that\r\nwere interest bearing when established.\r\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims\r\non accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE\r\nwith a credit balance of 50,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest\r\nwas discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust\r\nera, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs.\r\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all\r\nunclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).\r\n\r\nBeing a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary\r\ncontacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be\r\nbanked in the U.A.E Dubia, being a tax free country, where we can safely withdrew the funds and we can share the funds and use  it for investment of our choice.\r\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim\r\nthe funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your\r\ndetails for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim\r\ndocuments for transfer of the funds to you.\r\nKindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I\r\nwill pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a\r\nsecure, numbered account in your name in the U.A.E Bank in Dubia, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of  your choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.\r\n\r\nYou can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the\r\ninternet at the following websites:\r\nwww.swissbankclaims.com\r\nhttp://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9902/09/germany.holocaust/\r\n\r\nwww.avotaynu.com\r\nwww.icheic.org\r\nwww.livingheirs.com\r\nwww.wiesenthal.com\r\n\r\nThe Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting\r\nsubmission of valid claims for necessary disbursement.\r\nI find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a\r\ngreat opportunity for a life time of success without risks.\r\nDue to security reasons, reply to my via email only. You may reply to\r\nme securely on the following email,\r\nfrank1@mailsurf.com  or frankeze_2004@fastermail.com\r\nThank you for your prompt response.\r\nMr Frank Eze\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-998", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr Frank\" <frank13_@mailsurf.com>", "Mr Frank <frank13_@mailsurf.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200407140514.i6E5Emxp023765@fate.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "Request for personal assistance", "dc:title": "Request for personal assistance", "dcterms:created": "2004-07-14T05:14:24Z"}
