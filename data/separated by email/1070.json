The owner of this account is Mr. Jurgen T.Dormann, a foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1999. And no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Jurgen T.Dormann until his death was the Coy. (pty). SA. \n\nWe will start the first transfer with Twenty four million [$24,000.000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount of ($ 40,000.000.00 USD) to your account.\n\nThe amount involved is ($64,000.000.00 USD) Sixty four million United States Dollars, only I want to first transfer $24,000.000.00 [twenty four million United States Dollar ]from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.Jurgen T.Dormann is a foreigner too, and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.\n\nHowever, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got your contact address from South Africa chamber of commerce, I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.\n\nI need your full co-operation to make this work fine. Because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.\n\nWith my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account.\n\nI will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account.
