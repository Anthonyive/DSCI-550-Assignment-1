As you read this,I don't want you\r\nto feel sorry for me, because I believe everyone will\r\ndie someday. My name is Raad Ibrahim, a former\r\nmerchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.(United Arab\r\nEmirates), I have been diagnosed with Esophageal\r\ncancer which was discovered very late, due to my\r\nlaxity in caring for my health.\r\n\r\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I\r\nhave only about a few months to live, according to\r\nmedical experts. I have not particularly lived my life\r\nso well, as I never really cared for anyone not even\r\nmyself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was\r\nnever generous, I was always hostile to people and\r\nonly focus on my business as that was the only thing I\r\ncared for, but now I regret all this as I now know\r\nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have\r\nor make all the money in the world.\r\n\r\nI believe when I have a second chance to come to this\r\nworld I would live my life a different way from how I\r\nhad lived it, now that it is dark for me, I have\r\nwilled and given most of my properties and assets to\r\nmy immediate and extended family members and as well\r\nas a few close friends. To correct my wrong past life,\r\nI have decided to give alms to charity organizations,\r\nas I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on\r\nearth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity\r\norganizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now\r\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do\r\nthis my self anymore.\r\n\r\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my\r\naccounts and distribute the money which I have there\r\nto charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they\r\nrefused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do\r\nnot trust them anymore, as they seem not to be\r\ncontended with what I have left for them. The last of\r\nmy money which no one knows of is the huge cash\r\ndeposit of 15,000,000 million dollars, (fifteen\r\nmillion dollars), that I have with a Fiducial Company\r\nin Europe I will want you to help me collect this\r\ndeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and\r\nyou must be sending me information of how it was\r\ndisbursed either by email to:raadibrahim004@netscape.net\r\nor otherwise.\r\n\r\n10% of the funds(15 million), will be for your time and patience,\r\nlogistics and overhead.\r\n\r\nI wait in anticipation for your response.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRaad Ibrahim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1052", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Raad Ibrahim\" <raad004@netscape.net>", "Raad Ibrahim <raad004@netscape.net>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200408081849.i78InbPm032416@mail.eecs.UM>", "dc:subject": "URGENT ASSISTANCE.", "dc:title": "URGENT ASSISTANCE.", "dcterms:created": "2004-08-08T19:50:13Z"}
