My name is Momoni Adoh . I am the regional manager of International Commercial Bank Takoradi branch eastern region of the Republic of Ghana (West Africa). I write you this letter in good faith. I got your contact address from a recent banking forum held in Lome the capital city of Togo our next door neighbor, hence I write you to ask for your assistance in a business venture that will benefit you and I.\r\n\r\nOn January of 2000, one Mr. Dennis Burles who has been living and working in a gold company called Obuasi Goldfields died in the Kenya airways fatal air crash on the coast of Cote D Ivorie on its way to Accra  the capital city of Ghana.\r\n\r\nI was the personal banker to the late Mr. Burles, before his untimely death. You see my friend, the late Mr. Burles had $3M USD deposited in a fixed deposit account in my branch, without any next of kin to inherit the sum, that is the reason I write you this letter. I need you to stand claim as the next of kin so that my bank will not declare this funds a deceased account non-grata, meaning that the bank has full and legal right to claim the funds, since the policy of the bank on deceased customer account is that after 5 years if there is no claim, the funds will be immediately taken by the bank.\r\n\r\nFrankly speaking I have been working in this bank for close to 10 years and I have nothing to show for it, my yearly income is barely about $2,500 USD after tax and the major reason I packaged this transaction is that I have a 9 year old daughter with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant or she will die. I have already made arrangement for this surgery in the UK but I could not afford it, so I really need your help to do this deal or my daughter will die. I am offering you 25% of the total sum after this money is wired to your account, because it is a simple bank-to-bank inheritance claim payment transfer. I will also like you to get me rest assured that you will not abandon me when the money gets to your account. You can reach me on tell: +233 244231712, I have all the payment claim information worked out. Bye for now and thanks for your understanding.\r\n\r\n Best regards,\r\n Mr. Momoni Adoh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1056", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr. Momoni  Adoh\" <monughabomonu@yahoo.com> ", "Mr. Momoni  Adoh <monughabomonu@yahoo.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200408110131.i7B1V8LP000805@idoldancer.mr.itd.UM> ", "dc:subject": " please urgent ", "dc:title": " please urgent ", "dcterms:created": "2004-08-11T01:31:15Z"}
