I shall however provide you with directives on what to do as we proceed.Contact me on my private e-mail address:(drikonsdonldez@post.cz) with information about your full contact addresses including your personal telephone & fax numbers and\r\nBank information immediately if you are interested. As soon as I get this information and I am convinced that you are capable to do this transaction,I will consult a probate lawyer on your behalf as the beneficiary for the drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the neccesary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favour so as to put you in better position as the beneficiary .Please you have to be eraborate in your profile to enable\r\nme make a good assessment about your desirability.I shall tell you the name of my bank soon after I am convinced of your personality.\r\n\r\nI also need strong assurances from you to the effect that you can guarantee the safety of the money when it gets to your account.However,I want you to understand that as a man of strong character it beats my conscience that I have to do this deal for two strong reasons.Firstly ,to\r\ncurtail the excesses of the directors and secondly to plan ahead of my retirement which is just few months from now.In view of this,you may be approached after the transfer to provide me with investment advice as I plan to invest the fund in any lucrative venture after retirement.\r\nAt the conclusion of this business, I shall travel to your country for sharing.I have mapped out 30% of the total amount for you for assisting me,5% to take care of all expenses from both party and the remaining for me.\r\n\r\nI await information about you and look forward for prompt reply from you.\r\n\r\nWarmest Regards.\r\n\r\nDr.Donald Ike\r\nE-mail:drikonsdonldez@post.cz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1103", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Dr.Donald Ike\" <drikesdonaldson@yahoo.ca>", "Dr.Donald Ike <drikesdonaldson@yahoo.ca>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200408310342.i7V3geHI001600@cryforhelp.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "RE:VERY IMPORTANT FROM DONALD.", "dc:title": "RE:VERY IMPORTANT FROM DONALD.", "dcterms:created": "1980-01-03T10:02:05Z"}
