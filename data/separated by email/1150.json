Hope everyone is in good health.\r\nI am THEO MALOBU a citizen of Zimbabwe. I am contacting you from\r\nCotonou, the Republic of Benin where I was given asylum this year.\r\n\r\nI am the only son of late politician KENNETH MALOBU who was a\r\nwealthy known farmer in Zimbabwe in partnership with late Martin\r\nOlds who was also murdered like my father in April 2000. I wouldn\u2019t\r\ngo much deep detailing but you can have a look on this site if you\r\nhave the time and see what kind of brutal president we have.\r\n<<<<http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html>>>>\r\n\r\nAm appealing to you to consider the idea of assisting me in getting\r\nmy fund left behind for me by my late father which was safely kept\r\nwith a firm in Europe. My status will never in anyway permit me for\r\ncarrying out this function being that i am in asylum.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the consignments as cash was undeclared to the\r\ncompany but as family valuables. It is the sum of US$7,000.000.00\r\n(SEVEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) cash. If this does interest\r\nyou, we can go further for more details and negotiate terms.\r\n\r\nPlease, let me know if you can assist me and kindly contact me via\r\nmy Private mail box below so I can give you more details on how we\r\nshall proceed ( theomalobu@hotmail.ro )\r\n\r\nAs I wait for your urgent response, I advise you kindly keep this\r\nas top secret for now for my protection.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTHEO MALOBU\r\ntheomalobu@hotmail.ro\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://email.luxweb.com - votre adresse @email.lu gratuite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1120", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["theomalobu@email.lu", "theomalobu@email.lu"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=iso-8859-1", "dc:subject": "FAITHFUL COLLABORATION.", "dc:title": "FAITHFUL COLLABORATION.", "dcterms:created": "2004-09-17T18:28:04Z"}
