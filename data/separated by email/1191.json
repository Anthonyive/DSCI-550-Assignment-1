Since it is now obvious that I may not survive my poor state of\r\nhealth,\r\n\r\nI have deemed it necessary to leave a legacy on Earth and give a\r\npositive account and justification of the life I lived on Earth before\r\nthe Almighty Allah who will punish all those unbelivers and evil doers\r\nthat murderd my husband and wants to control the Iraq oil wealth in the\r\nname of war against terrorism.\r\n\r\nThis I want to achieve by committing part of this wealth in all\r\nsincerlity to fund mosques, Islamic orphanages,widows and also\r\npropagating the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the\r\nviews and beliefs of the holy Quran. The holy Quran emphasized so much\r\non ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step\r\nhence the reason for taking this bold decision, I know that afterdeath,\r\ni\r\nwill be with ALLAH the most beneficent and the most merciful.\r\nPlease, note that this sum(us$12.4 Million) was securely deposited in a\r\nsecurity/financial company overseas in my name by my husband . I have\r\nhighlighted my attorney on the said sum and all the possible assistance\r\nhe wouldrender to you on the documents covering the money so as to\r\nenable you receive it as I cannot follow it up because of my ill\r\nhealth.Presently, my attorny is in on assylum as he is also wanted by\r\nthe American/British coallision forces in Iraq.\r\n\r\nI will also issue you a letter of authorization to anable the money be\r\npaid into your account.I want you and the Muslim community where you\r\nreside to always pray for me,My happiness is that i lived a life of a\r\ntrue devoted muslim worthy of emulation.\r\nLastly, I honestly pray that this money when remitted to you will be\r\njudiciously used for the said purpose and you will take 10% as a\r\ncompensation for your assistance in carrying out these humanitarian\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nWhoever wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness.\r\nPlease always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your\r\nreply will give me room to source for a muslim organisation or a devoted\r\nmuslim for this same purpose.Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest\r\nsquarely on your shoulders. May the almighty ALLAH continue to bless\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\nMrs. Mariam Khalifa,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1161", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mrs. Mariam Khalifa\" <mariamkhalifa200ad@arabtop.net>", "Mrs. Mariam Khalifa <mariamkhalifa200ad@arabtop.net>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200409261849.i8QInJh4025364@threefriends.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "READ AND REPLY", "dc:title": "READ AND REPLY", "dcterms:created": "2004-09-26T18:49:20Z"}
