Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and\ncrave your indulgence to make this project request for\na joint business transaction which I hope will not\ncome to you as a surprise, hence I plead for\nyour pardon.\n\nI am Dr.Sam Jordan, the  Manager of headquarter\nFirst Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and\nconfidentialbusiness proposal for you. \n\nOn June 6, 1998, an Italian oil\nconsultant/contractor with via National Petroleum\ncooperation (NNPC) Mr. Paul Bush made a numbered time\n(fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at\nUS$43.7,000.00 in my branch.\n\nOn maturity, I sent a routine notification to his\nforwarded address but got no reply after months we\nsend a reminder and finally we discovered from his\ncontract employee (Nigeria national petroleum\nCorporation) that Mr. Paul Bush died from an\nautomobile accident. On further investigation, it was\nclear  that he died without making a will. All\nattempts by the Australian to trace his next of\nkin were fruitless.\n\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered\nthat Mr. Paul Bush did not declare any next of kin or\nrelations in all his official documents including his\ndeposit document in my bank. The total sum\nUS$43.7,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant\nacct.\nNo one will ever come forward to claim it. According\nto Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money\nwill revert to the ownership of the Nigerian\nGovernment. If the account owner is certified death\nand nobody comes forward to claim it.\n\nThis is the situation , and my proposal is that I am\nlooking for a foreigner who will stand in as the\nbeneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you have\nto do is to immediately send me the details of a bank\naccount anywhere in the world for me to arrange the\nproper money transfer document. The money will then be\ntransferred into the account for us to share in the\nration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining\n10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with\nhere and there.\n\nThere is no risk involved. I am using my position and\nconnection in the bank here to do all the document\nwork for the transaction. We shall employ the services\nof an attorney to draft the will and obtain all\nnecessary documents and letter of administration in\nyour fovour for the transfer. This transaction is risk\nfree guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply\nimmediately confidentiality and be rest assured that\nthis transaction could be most profitable for both of\nus. Please do not expose this deal if you are not\ninterested because if you do, it will take me out\nof seat.Please expenses is involve in this\nbusiness,phone/fax number,and your bank particulars.\n\nI am awaiting your urgent reply.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr.Sam Jordan.\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-12", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "6", "dc:creator": ["\"Dr.Sam jordan\" <sjordan@diplomats.com>", "Dr.Sam jordan <sjordan@diplomats.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=\"iso-8859-1\"", "dc:identifier": "<200211080415.gA84FYF26895@bloodwork.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "URGENT ASSISTANCE.", "dc:title": "URGENT ASSISTANCE.", "dcterms:created": "2002-11-08T12:15:33Z"}
