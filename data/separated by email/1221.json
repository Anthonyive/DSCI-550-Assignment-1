Which ever way you want it,feel free to notify me.I have also mapped out %5 of the money for all kinds of expenses incured in the process of the transaction and if you don't prefer joint partnership,i am offering you %20 of the fund while the rest %75 will be for my investment.\r\nPls contact me immidiately so we can proceed in details.\r\nEmail: aali503h@yahoo.co.uk </ym/Compose?To=aali503h@yahoo.co.uk>\r\nThank you for your coperation.\r\nMr. Ahmed Ali. .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1191", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr.   AHMED   ALI.\" <aahhaali2@yahoo.com>", "Mr.   AHMED   ALI. <aahhaali2@yahoo.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200410131550.i9DFoVR2003139@brazil.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "I NEED YOUR COPERATION", "dc:title": "I NEED YOUR COPERATION", "dcterms:created": "2004-10-13T15:50:25Z"}
