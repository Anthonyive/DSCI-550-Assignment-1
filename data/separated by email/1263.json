I am presently\r\nresiding in SOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI got your contact from the SOUTH AFRICA INFORMATION EXCHANGE (S.A.I.E)\r\nin Johannesburg and on behalf of my mother who is a widow MRS ANGELA\r\nDUNGA. I decided to solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of\r\nUS$ 18.5M (Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States\r\nDollars)\r\nin your personal or company account. Before my father\u2019s death, he was\r\namong the few black Zimbabweans rich farmers, and, he was poisoned by\r\nthe agents of the ruling government of president ROBERT MUGABE for his\r\nalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition party controlled\r\nby white minority. Before his death, he had taken me to Johannesburg to\r\ndeposit his money to a Security and Finance Company. This money was\r\ndeposited as a gemstone to avoid much demurrage from the Security\r\nCompany.\r\nThis money was earmarked for purchase of new machinery and chemicals\r\nfor the farms and to establish new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this will, he specifically drew my attention to this sum of US$18.5M\r\n(Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) that he\r\ndeposited in safe box of a private Security and Finance Company here in\r\nJohannesburg, South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFACT MY FATHER SAID IN HIS WILL AND QUOTE:\r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMy beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to this money which I\r\ndeposited in your name in a box with a Security and Finance Company in\r\nJohannesburg, South Africa. In case of my absence on earth caused by\r\ndeath, you should solicit for a reliable foreign partner to transfer\r\nthis\r\nmoney out of South Africa for investment purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n>From the above, you will understand that life and future of my family\r\ndepends on this money, as much I will be very grateful if you can\r\nassist\r\nus. We are now living in South Africa as asylum seekers and financial\r\nlaws of South Africa does not allow asylum seekers certain right to\r\nsuch\r\nhuge amount of money. In view of this, I can not invest this money in\r\nSouth Africa hence am asking you to assist me to transfer this money\r\nout\r\nof South Africa for investment purposes. For your effort, I am prepared\r\nto offer you 25% of the total fund. While 5% will be set my family and\r\nI will keep aside for local and international expenses and 70%. Finally\r\nmodalities on how the transfer will be done will be conveyed to once we\r\nestablish trust and confidence between ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply including your full name, and your full\r\ndirect phone & fax numbers, and please treat as very urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCE IBRAHIM DUNGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1233", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Ibrahim Dunga\" <ibradunga@hotmail.com> ", "Ibrahim Dunga <ibradunga@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200411081648.iA8Gm3h2008039@flawless.mail.UM> ", "dc:subject": "Confidential", "dc:title": "Confidential", "dcterms:created": "2004-11-08T16:48:05Z"}
