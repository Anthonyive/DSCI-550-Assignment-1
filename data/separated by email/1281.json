And the banking \nethics here does not allow such money to stay more than eight years, because \nmoney will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.\nIn view of this i will give you 30% of the total. Upon the receipt of\nyour response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax \nnumber and the next step to take.I will not fail to bring to your\nnotice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain \nany fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five \nbanking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.\nWhen you receive this letter.
