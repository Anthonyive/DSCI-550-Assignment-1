Paul O. Otobo\nPretoria\nSouth Africa.\nEmail: potobo3@walla.com                    \n                     \n\n\nDear Sir, \nIt is my great pleasure to write you this letter on\nbehalf of my colleagues. Your information were given\nto me by a member of the South African Export\nPromotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black\nEconomic Empowerment Commission (Government)\ndelegation on a trip to the United States during a\nbilateral conference talk to encourage foreign\ninvestors. I have decided to seek a confidential\nco-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder\nfor the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep\nit confidential because of the nature of this\nbusiness. \nWithin the Department of Mining Resources where I work\nas the Director of Project Implementation, with\nco-operation of two other top officials, we have in\nour possession, an overdue payment in US funds. \nThe said funds represent certain percentage of the\ncontract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a\nforeign contracting firm, which we the officials\nover-invoiced to the amount of\nUS$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred\nThousand United States Dollars). Though the actual\ncontract cost has been paid to the original\ncontractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. \nThe Government of the Republic of South Africa believe\nthat private investment in general, and foreign direct\ninvestment in particular, are the real engines for\nsustainable economic development, for which reason it\nhas continued to encouraged investment in the key\ngrowth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere\ndetermination to pay foreign contractors all debts\nowed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close\nrelationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation\nwith foreign governments and non-governmental\nfinancial agencies. As a result we included our bills\nfor approvals with the co-operation of some officials\nat the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of\nSouth Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to\nbe the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we\nare not allowed to operate foreign account. The\nchanging of beneficiary's information/ details and\nother forms of documentation upon application for\nclaim to reflect the contract money and its approvals\nwill be secured on behalf of your company or your\nself. \nI have the authority of my colleagues involved to\npropose that, should you be willing to assist us in\nthis transaction your share as compensation will be\n20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and\nthe balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all\nexpenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so\nincurred. \nIt does not matter whether or not your company does\ncontract projects of the nature described here. The\nassumption is that your company won the major contract\nand subcontracted it to other companies. More often\nthan not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated\nfields win major contracts, and subcontract to more\nspecialized firms for execution. \nThis business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat\nit with utmost confidentiality. Also your\nspecialization is not a hindrance to the successful\nexecution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I\nhave reposed my confidence in you and hope that you\nwill not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further\ndetails, upon your acceptance of this proposal.Pls send \nall correspondence to potobo2@netscape.net \nRegards,\nEngr Paul O. Otobo.\npotobo2@netscape.net\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1284", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Paul Otobo\" <potobo3@walla.com>", "Paul Otobo <potobo3@walla.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;", "dc:identifier": "<200411250433.iAP4XiS4015436@brazil.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "Review", "dc:title": "Review", "dcterms:created": "2004-11-26T10:01:57Z"}
