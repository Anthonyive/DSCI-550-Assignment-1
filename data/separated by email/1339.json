I have an\nurgent and very confidential business proposition for you.\n \n On July 8, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor with\nthe South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Phillip\nMorris made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve\ncalendar months, valued at (Twenty-eight Million Three\nHundred Thousand American Dollars only) in my branch.\n \n Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his\nforwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent\na reminder and finally we discovered from his contract\nemployers, that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an auto-mobile\naccident.\n \n On further investigation, I found out that he died without\nmaking a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was\nfruitless.\n \n I therefore made further investigation and discovered that\nMr.Phillip Morris did not declare any kin or relations in\nall his official documents,including his Bank Deposit\npaperwork in my Bank.This sum of $28,300,000.00 is still\nsitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over\nwith the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will\never come forward to claim it.\n \n According to Laws of South Korea, at the expiration of \n(five) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the\nSouth Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\n \n Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a\nforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip\nMorris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not\nget into the hands of some corrupt government officials.\n \n This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately \nyour full names and address so that the attorney will \nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put\nyou in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the\nservices of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the\nWILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of\nprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\n \n A bank account in any part of the world that you will \nprovide the will, then facilitate the transfer of this \nmoney to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.\n \n The money will be paid into your account for us to share in\nthe ratio of 70%for me and 25% for you and 5%  for Expenses\nIncurred in the course of the transaction\n .\n \n There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this \ntransaction will be done by the attorney and with my\nposition as the credit officer guarantees the successful\nexecution of this transaction. If you are interested, please\nreply immediately to my email box.\n \n Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more \ndetails that will help you  understand the transaction.\n \n Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers\nfor easy communication.\n \n You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured\nthat this transaction would be most profitable  for both of\nus because I shall require your assistance  to invest my\nshare in your country.\n \n \n Regards,\n Soo Cho\n\nN.B:Endeavour to send your reply through my alternative\ne-mail address:soo@financesource.com\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1307", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:identifier": "<41b36163.3e5.2a2a.18994@btconnect.com> ", "dc:subject": "TESTAMENT", "dc:title": "TESTAMENT", "dcterms:created": "2004-12-05T19:28:35Z"}
