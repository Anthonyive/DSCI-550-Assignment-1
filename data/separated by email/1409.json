If you have any other idea of investment, that would be welcomed by me.\n\n\n\nIn the course of our duties as values, and project inspectors for the on-going liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project, we have over-invoiced the value of some jobs done by foreign contractors for the NNPC to the tune of US$31M.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs follows: -\n\n(1) Computer optimization and Installation 16,000.000.00.\n\n(2) Installation of 250,000.00 Monax Turbine$10,000.000.00\n\n(3) Turn around Maintenance $5,000,000.00\n\n\n\nThe money will be shared as follows after transfer, 30% for you (Account Owner) 70% for me and my colleagues. To be able to claim the funds, we will be purporting your company as one of the contractor / beneficiary of the funds so all procedures for international transfer shall be strictly followed, as we have worked out all modalities for a swift and risk free transfer.\n\n\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nEngr Mamud Takar.\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site\n\n- http://yoursite.com\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1377", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["mtakar <kamsi_muna@yahoo.com.hk>", "mtakar <kamsi_muna@yahoo.com.hk>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "dc:subject": "TRUST VENTURE!!", "dc:title": "TRUST VENTURE!!"}
