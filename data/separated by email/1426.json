Our request \nfor a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the \ncustomer was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of kin. To \neffect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed, you must \napply first to the bank as the next of kin to the decease, The fund \nshall then be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down \nprocedures governing closure of account and transfer of funds. \nIf you are willing to assist us, we have agree to give you 20 Percent \nof USD $10.7 million  \nNote that this transaction is legal,safe and 100% risk free.\n  Upon receipt of your reply which should includes the following:\n\n1) Your Full Name \n2) Your telephone number for easy communication between us.\n\nI will confidentially work out all modalities for the successful \ntransfer of this money to you as the beneficiary, and send to you by \nfax or email attachement the text of the application, as soon as you \nreceive the text I will further clarify you in details on how to effect \nthe business. \n\nAwait to hear from you \nBest Regards \nEvans Timothy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1394", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["EVANSTIMOTHY <EVANSTIMOTHY@terra.es> ", "EVANSTIMOTHY <EVANSTIMOTHY@terra.es>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "dc:identifier": "<2a6712e3e7.2e3e72a671@teleline.es> At this juncture i have decided to do business with you in", "dc:subject": "Business Venture", "dc:title": "Business Venture", "dcterms:created": "2005-01-27T13:19:16Z"}
