KENNETH FUZANE DANIEL NYERERE\nBUSINESS PROPOSAL\n\u00a0\nI do foresee the surprise this letter will bringto you as it comes from a stranger. But be rest assured as it comes with best of intentions. However, your address was courtesy of a business journal at the World Trade Centre in Johannesburg. But after ueconsideration from your profile, I became aware and\u00a0 assured of your credibility of handling this trust and\u00a0 my future.Thus, after my humble decision to solicit\u00a0 for your understanding and co-operation in this\u00a0 transaction, as it will be beneficial to all of us involved. My name is\u00a0 MR. KENNETH FUZANE DANIEL NYERERE from Tanzania. \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0I am the son of the Late President of Tanzania, JULIUS MWALIMU NYERERE who died about two years ago.\u00a0 My father used his position then to make for himself and us the family some fortune. My father died after a\n protracted illness. I was studying overseas when my\u00a0 father died and I was forced to return for the\u00a0 funeral. His attorney notified me and my family about\u00a0 my father's WILL with his chambers.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nWhen I was going through the WILL, I discovered that my late father had used his\u00a0 position\u00a0 then to make some\u00a0 money, which he brilliantly transferred and deposited with a private Security company here in Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa. \n\u00a0\nHe deposited this consignment as valuables.The Security Company does not know that this consignment contains cash money, except the attorney and I. The amount is (Eighteen\u00a0 million United States Dollars USD 18,000,000.00 MILLION). However, my aim of contacting you is for you to help me lodge the whole\u00a0 sum into your nominated account in your country or any other part of the world. Secondly, you will also help me look for profitable investment overseas because I don't have knowledge of\u00a0 international investments. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAs a result of my present situation, I won't be able to conclude this transaction alone. If you are interested in helping me out, try and contact me with the above telephone number or my above\u00a0 e-mail address indicating your interest to help me,not forgetting to include your private phone and fax numbers for easier communication. I will then\n\u00a0furnish you with more details. \n\u00a0 \nI have mutually agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total sum for your ssistance,\u00a0\u00a0 Then the remaining 75% will remain for my family and I, which you will help us invest. Be informed that this transaction needs utmost trust and confidentiality. Note also that the transaction attracts no risk on your side hence all the modalities for safe, smooth and successful transaction have been arranged by me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLooking forward to receiving your urgent reply. \n\n\nYours faithfully\nfor:\u00a0 THE FAMILY OF LATE JULIUS MWALIMU NYERERE\n\n\u00a0\n\nMR.
