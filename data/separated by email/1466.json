AFTER MY RELEASE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA HAS MADE ME SIGN SOME DOCUMENTS THAT WILL ENABLE THEM EXTRACT THE SUM OF ONE BILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION US DOLLARS FROM MY FATHER'S BANK ACCOUNTS IN LONDON,SWITZERLAND,LUXEMBIURG,LIECHTENSTEIN AND JESEY ETC. MY  FAMILY AND I ARE LOOKING FOR A TRUSTWORTHY FOREIGN PARTNER WHO CAN ASSIST  US BY TAKING POSESSION OF THE TOTAL SUM OF US$28,200,000.00 ( TWENTY  EIGHT MILLION , TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ), WHICH THE  GOVERNMENT DID NOT KNOW ABOUT. BECAUSE IN THEIR THINKING THEY WANT TO  LEAVE ONLY ONE HUNDRED MILLION TO MY FAMILY.  THIS MONEY IS PRESENTLY IN  THE POSSESSION OF A SECURITY COMPANY ABROAD. THIS MONEY WAS OF COURSE,  ACQUIRED BY MY LATE FATHER AND IS NOW KEPT SECRETLY BY THE FAMILY. THE  SWISS GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY FROZEN ALL OTHER ACCOUNTS OF MY FAMILY IN  SWITZERLAND, AND SOME OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO TRIED DOING LIKE WISE. THIS  BID BY SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DEAL WITH THIS FAMILY HAS MADE IT  NECESSARY THAT I SEEK YOUR ASSISITANCE IN RECEIVING THIS MONEY AND IN  INVESTING IT ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY. THIS MUST BE A JOINT VENTURE  TRANSACTION AND WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER. \nSINCE THIS MONEY IS STILL  CASH, EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PROTECT IT FROM THEFT OR SEIZURE. I HAVE PERSONALLY WORKED OUT ALL MODALITIES FOR THE PEACEFUL CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION WITH THE SECUITY COMPANY. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE GROUNDS THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME AND ALSO ALL CONTENTIOUS ISSUES DISCUSSED BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS TRANSACTION. \nYOU MAY ALSO DISCUSS YOUR PERCENTAGE BEFORE WE START TO WORK.AS SOON AS I HEAR FROM YOU, I WILL GIVE YOU ALL NECESSARY DETAILS AS TO HOW WE INTEND TO CARRY OUT THE WHOLE TRANSACTION. PLEASE, DO NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEARS, AS ALL NECESSARY MODALITIES ARE IN PLACE, AND I ASSURE YOU OF ALL SUCCESS AND SAFETY IN THIS TRANSACTION. PLEASE, THIS TRANSACTION REQUIRES ABSOLUTE CONFIDENTIALITY AND YOU WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TREAT IT AS SUCH. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ASSISTING ME. \nPLEASE SEND ME YOUR CONCENT AND TELEPHONE NUMBER FOR FURTHER COMMUNICATION.  \nYOU MAY ALSO IGNORE THIS LETTER AND RESPECT MY TRUST IN YOU BY NOT EXPOSING THIS TRANSACTION, SHOULD YOU NOT BE INTERESTED.\nYOU MAY ALSO REPLY TO ANY OF MY PRIVATE EMAILS: abachmmed@yahoo.es   or   mohab223@myway.com  \nI LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. \nTHANK YOU.\nALHAJI MOHAMMED ABACHA \n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1433", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["abachmmed@yahoo.es", "abachmmed@yahoo.es"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=US-ASCII", "dc:identifier": "<200502111400.j1BE0oc9009318@burn2.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "APPEAL", "dc:title": "APPEAL", "dcterms:created": "2002-01-04T03:30:03Z"}
