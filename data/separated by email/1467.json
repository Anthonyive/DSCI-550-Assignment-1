Upon  maturity,I sent a routine\nnotification to his forwarding address but got no \nreply. \n\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally\nwe discovered from his  caontract employers, the\nChinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr.Raymond \nBeck  died in a plane crash along with his wife Mr and\nMrs Raymond & Dorene  Beck in EgyptAir Flight 990,1999\nair crash(for more information about this  crash and\nperson you can contact this website: \nhttp://www.s-t.com/daily/11-99/11-02-99/d08ho174.htm\nSince we got this  information about his death.\n\nOn further investigation, I found out that he  died\nwithout making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his\nnext of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further\ninvestigation and discovered that  Mr.Raymond Beck did\nnot declare any kin or relations in all his official \ndocuments, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my\nBank. \n\nThis sum of  US$18,000,000.00 is still sitting\nin my Bank and the interest is being  rolled over with\nthe principal sum at the end of each year. No one will\never  come forward to claim it.     According to Laws\nof Republic of China, at the expiration of 5 (five)\nyears, the money will revert to the ownership of  the\nChinese Government if nobody applies to claim the\nfund.
