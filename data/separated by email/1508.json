If i don't remit this money\nimmediately, it will get lost(may be it will go into the\npockets of the corrupt government officials who will never\nuse it for any reasonable thing at all).\nI dont want to miss this opportunity because it comes ones\nin a life time.\n\nThe amount involved is $28.5 million(USD)Twenty eight\nmillion,five hundred United States Dollars and no other \nperson knows about this account.

I am only contacting\nyou as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved\nto a local person here, without a valid foreign\ninternational  passport, but can only be approved to any\nforeigner with valid international passport or drivers\nlicense and foreign a/c, this is because the money is in\nUS Dollars and the former owner of the a/c, Alvaro Quesada\nis a foreigner too, and as such the money can only be\napproved into a foreign a/c.\n\nHowever,  I am revealing this to you with belief in God\nthat you will never let me down in this business.I don't\nknow you and have never seen you before,i only got your\ncontacts from an international directory which my\nsecretary provided for me.

Send also your private telephone and fax number.\n\nI need your full co-operation to make this work because\nthe management is ready to approve this payment to any\nforeigner who has correct information of this account,\nwhich I will give to you, upon your positive response and\nonce I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up\nwith instruction of a keybank official who is deeply\ninvolved with me in this business.\nI want to tell you that this transaction is 100% risk free\nand legal because all the documents that will back up this\ntransaction will be available, so that no body will\nquestion the fund when it is finaly tranfered to your\naccount.\n\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40%\nof the total amount and 60% will be for me.
