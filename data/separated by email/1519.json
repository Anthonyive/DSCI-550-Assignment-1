Actually, we have paid all our contractors both local\r\nand foreign because they agitated for their payments when they heared that\r\nmy boss was arrested and might eventually be jailed by the\r\nRussianGovernment.\r\nYOUR ROLE:\r\nI will present you/your company as one of the contractors we are owing so\r\nthat you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or part of the\r\nfund according to your financial strength or the strength of your company.
