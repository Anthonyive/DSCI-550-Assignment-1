It was my consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne out of our beleive in the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-region. \n\n\nThe original contractors have been duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African States)This balanceis suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice.I intend to pay out this fund now as the organisation is winding up its activities. Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise,assistance and\npartnership in your country. \n\n\nI have however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40% of the entire sum as\ncompensation,why 55% will be held on trust for me while 5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost if any,during the course of the transactions.\nThis transaction will be successfully concluded within 5-7 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the followings. \n\n\nNAME OF YOUR BANK....................................\nADDRESS OF THE BANK..................................\nACCOUNT NUMBER.......................................\nBENEFICIARY\u2019S NAME...................................\nTEL/FAX NUMBERS OF THE BANK..........................\nCOUNTRY OF BANK......................................\nYOUR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER.............................\nYOUR AGE.............................................\nOCCUPATION...........................................\n\n\nUpon the receipt of this informations,the certificate of job completion of one of the contracts will be issued in your for the transfering of the fund to your nominated account without delay.As with the case of all organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS,we solicit for our unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire peacefully\nand lead a honourable business life afterwards. There are no risks involved. \n\n\nWell, this is the sharing ratio of this $14.3M for both of us:-\n\n\n1) I want you to know that my 55% from this fund $14.3M is: $ 7,865,000 :00.\n\n\n2) While your own 40% from this fund $14.3M is: $5,720,000:00.\n\n\n3) While 5% from this fund $14.3M for any expenses Made by you and me is: $7,15,000:00.\n\n\n\nREPLY ASAP. \nWith regards. \nMr. Ferdinand Edward\nAlternative auditoredward@mighty.co.za\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSOS Aldeas Infantiles.
