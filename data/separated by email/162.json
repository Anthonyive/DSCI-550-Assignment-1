I am Dr Stephen Umah,I am 41 Years old and\r\n also the  chief accountant with Gulf Bank Nig PLC . I have a\r\n transaction which I think will be of mutual benefit\r\n to both  of us. In my desire for a foreign partner with whom\r\n to do  this ransaction, I stumbled on your contact from a\r\n business  directory.\r\n As the head of accounts department of GBNP, I\r\n discovered  some amount of money while I was auditing accounts\r\n for the  2001 financial year which has been lying there for\r\n over 3  years. On further inquiry, I discovered that this\r\n money  totalling about USD$45.5 Million (Forty five Million\r\n five  hundred thousand United States Dollars) including\r\n accumulated interest belonged to one MR. H .LEE , a\r\n korea  Nationale who lived here and died intestate with no\r\n beneficiary.\r\n This man died through a plane crash of ADC airlines\r\n in  1998. I have Successfully secured the money and with\r\n the  assistance of my colleague, the money has been moved\r\n out of  my bank and deposited in a finances company. It was\r\n packed  in three(3)metal trunk boxes as photographic\r\n materials. I  would need your particulars to enable me prepare\r\n documents  which will authenticate that the Consignment belongs\r\n to you  as the next of kin to MR. H .LEE and to enable you\r\n claim  the money. I want to be assured of a safe account\r\n where the  money will be deposited pending my arrival. This\r\n transaction is absolutely risk free with no illegal\r\n complications, I have made all necessary\r\n arrangements for a  successful transaction. Before this money is\r\n entrusted into  your care, there must be an agreement that will be\r\n reached  between us stating that:\r\n\r\n 1.BOTH PARTIES WILL NOT FOR ANY REASON CHEAT EACH\r\n OTHER.\r\n 2.BOTH PARTIES WILL WORK TOGETHER TO SEE THIS\r\n TRANSACTION  THROUGH.\r\n 3.A HIGH DEGREE OF TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY WILL BE\r\n APPLIED FOR THE SAKE OF OUR WORK.\r\n 4.I AND MY PARTNER WILL STRONGLY BE BY YOUR SIDE\r\n AS YOU CLAIM THIS FUND AND I AND MY PARTNER WILL\r\n ARRAGE AN ATTORNEY (LAWYER)WHO WILL WORK ON\r\n YOUR BEHALF TO GET THE NECESSARY\r\n PAPERS NEEDED FOR A SMOOTH TRANSACTION.\r\n 5.YOU WILL NOT DISAPPEAR WITH OUR FUND AFTER\r\n YOU HAVE CLAIMED IT.\r\n 6.DISBURSEMENT RATIO WILL BE 75% FOR ME AND MY\r\n COLLEAGUE,15% FOR YOU, 5% WILL BE DONATED TO\r\n CHARITY,WHILE\r\n\r\n 5% WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR MUTUALEXPENCES.\r\n There is need for you to respond to this offer\r\n immediately  as the government of my country have concluded plans\r\n to  apply the money into arms procurement to project\r\n wars and  unrest in African continent.\r\n I must let you know that a high degree of trust is\r\n required  and also we will like to use our own share to go\r\n into any  lucrative business with your help/assistance.\r\n Awaiting your urgent response now.\r\n Yours Faithfully\r\n\r\n DR Stephen Umah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-159", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"DR STEPHEN UMAH\" <u.stephen1@caramail.com> Plot 1212=2C tijian bello Street=2C that  Godwill give you the wisdom to understand my problem accumulated interest belonged to one MR=2E H =2ELEE =2C a complications=2C I have made all necessary YOUR BEHALF TO GET THE NECESSARY required  and also we will like to use our own share to go", "DR STEPHEN UMAH <u.stephen1@caramail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" DEAR SIR=2C business  directory=2E packed  in three=283=29metal trunk boxes as photographic 2=2EBOTH PARTIES WILL WORK TOGETHER TO SEE THIS ", "dc:identifier": "<200303220409.h2M49mA12918@deadpool.mr.itd.UM> HEAD OFFICE upto the letter=2E  First I must seek for your understanding and pray five  hundred thousand United States Dollars=29 including transaction is absolutely risk free with no illegal ARRAGE AN ATTORNEY =28LAWYER=29WHO WILL WORK ON I must let you know that a high degree of trust is", "dc:subject": "assistance", "dc:title": "assistance", "dcterms:created": "2003-03-22T13:09:19Z"}
