As such this account has no other beneficiary and my\r\ninvestigation proved to me as well that Eshed.B.Willey until his death was\r\nthe manager Oriental Diamond Company,in South Africa. However, if you are\r\ninterested in this business we will start the first money transfer with\r\nForfty Two Million\r\nU.S.Dollars (U.S.$42,000,000.00) upon successful transaction without any\r\ndisappointment from you. We shall also re-apply for the payment of the\r\nremaining amount to your account.\r\n\r\nWhile the total amount involved is One hundred and Forfty Two Million\r\nUnited States Dollars (U.S.$142000,000.00)only. I would want us to make a\r\nfirst transfer of Forfty Two Million United States\r\nDollar.(U.S.$4200,000.00)from this money into a safe foreigners account\r\nabroad before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because\r\nthis money can not be approved to a local account, without valid\r\ninternational foreign Agreement, but could only be approved to any\r\nforeigner with valid international credentials: passport or drivers\r\nlicense and foreign account because this sum is in U.S. dollars and the\r\nformer owner of the account Mr.Eshed.B.Willey is a foreigner too, thus the\r\nmoney could only be approved into a foreign account. However, knowing all\r\nthis, we will reach a binding agreement in this regards.As a matter of\r\nurgency, I will inform you the next step to take, while you Send your\r\nprivate telephone and fax number including the full details of the account\r\nto be used for the deposit.I want us to meet face to face to build\r\nconfidence and to sign a binding agreement that will\r\nbind us together before transferring the money to any account of your\r\nchoice where the fund will be safe.sharing and investments.\r\n\r\nI need your full co-operation to make this business a success, because the\r\nmanagement is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has\r\ncorrect information of this account,which I will give to you,upon your\r\npositive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will\r\nmeet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply\r\ninvolved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you\r\nwill never let me down. I would like you to send me your information as\r\nstated below:\r\n\r\n(1) Your Private: Tele& Fax Number :\r\n\r\n(2) Bank Name:\r\n\r\n(3) Bank Address:\r\n\r\n(4) Account Number:\r\n\r\n(5) Account Name:\r\n\r\n(6) Swift Code / Routing Number if any:\r\n\r\nWith my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money\r\nto any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance\r\nthat this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your\r\ncountry for sharing. And to build confidence that you can come immediately\r\nto discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in\r\nyour presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days\r\nahead of the money going into the account.\r\n\r\nI will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that\r\nyou are ready to act as directed. To prove the authenticity of the\r\nbusiness I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal\r\napprovals for onward transfer of this money to your account with\r\nappropriate clearance from the relevant ministries,foreign exchange\r\ndepartments, embassy and Board of Internal Revenue services. At the\r\nconclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount,\r\n60% will be for me,while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have\r\nincurred during this process.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your earliest reply.\r\n\r\nRegards and God Bless,\r\n\r\nMr White.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNueva Barra de Herramientas de OZ\u00da.
