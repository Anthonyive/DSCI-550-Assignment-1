Please be patient and read my email   to you.\r\n\r\nI am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group attached in Private Banking Services. I am contacting you \r\nconcerning a customer and, an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago, I \r\ncontacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication \r\nand I Would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, the subject matter; ref: bb/tsb/bank/73 came to our bank to engage in business \r\ndiscussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a \r\nfinancial portfolio of 8.35 million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn \r\nover on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in \r\nline with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services \r\nDepartment, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on \r\nnumerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various \r\ngrowth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by \r\nassessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative investments. Based \r\non my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for \r\nour first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 \r\nmillion United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he \r\ndesired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the money be \r\nliquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. \r\nHe directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe. I informed \r\nhim that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not \r\nto circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to \r\ncater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around \r\nwhen I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across \r\nborders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. \r\n\r\nI contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in main land Europe. I \r\nundertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter \r\nand had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private \r\nfirm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that \r\nhandle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This \r\nsmall and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and Well-\r\nconnected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited. He told me he \r\nwanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was \r\nthe last communication we had, this transpired around 20th  June 2002. In June last year, we \r\ngot a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio. \r\nThis was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the \r\nprivate banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not \r\nunderstand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.\r\n\r\n I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating him to the \r\ninternal investigations department of our bank. Four days later, information started to \r\ntrickle in, that he was apparently dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead \r\nof a heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the body \r\nand cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible \r\nsurviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his \r\nestate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services \r\nusually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In \r\nhis bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an \r\naccount with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name \r\ndepositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the \r\nchoice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring \r\nthat there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. \r\nPrivate banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave \r\nwills in our care, in this case; he died in testate.\r\n\r\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand \r\nsomething. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the \r\nbanking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge \r\nrewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have \r\nbegun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is US$ \r\n8,370,000.00 deposited, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to \r\nno one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as \r\nfar as the finance firm, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the \r\nfunds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer \r\nservices and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature \r\nof the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that \r\ncomes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to \r\ntrack this man's family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The \r\ninvestigation has come to an end.\r\n\r\n My proposal ,  you share similar details to the late fellow  I am prepared to place you in a \r\nposition to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving \r\nrelation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half and \r\nno more. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the \r\ndeposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50. I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be \r\nreleased to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming \r\nthe deposit. But on the other hand, you with a similar name as the original depositor would \r\neasily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim. I assure you that I could have the \r\ndeposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of \r\nthe file relating to the customer. I will then officially communicate with the finance company \r\nand instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as \r\naccountholder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the \r\nfirm. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this \r\nproposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this \r\nmail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, \r\ndelete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do \r\nnot approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy \r\nsums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal \r\nand what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, \r\nbut the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come \r\nones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by\r\n\r\nI hope you understand because for once I found myself in total control and face to face with \r\nmy destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you \r\nwill not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am \r\na family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a \r\nreward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks \r\nand the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am \r\nthe only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has \r\nplanted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing.\r\n\r\nIf you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to \r\ninform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about \r\nthis project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do \r\nI want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through this email \r\naddress (qin_wang1@o2.pl)\r\n\r\nI do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as \r\nthey are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total \r\nQuality Management Policy.\r\n\r\nPlease observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I happily \r\nmarried with two kids. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the \r\nconsequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that \r\nsuccess and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have \r\nlearned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one \r\naccord, we should plan a meeting, soon.\r\n\r\nI await your response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nQin Wang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfree|access - pripojeni k internetu zdarma na kterem vydelas\r\nPripoj se k internetu zdarma pres free|access a ziskej vyhody, ktere jinde nedostanes!\r\n\r\nwww.freeaccess.cz\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1661", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "2", "dc:creator": ["Qin <qinqinwang1@o2.pl> June last year, we=20", "Qin <qinqinwang1@o2.pl>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-2 identify the body=20", "dc:identifier": "<1117105534.4295ad7ea446d@webmail.freeaccess.cz> Cash movement across=20", "dc:subject": "Business project", "dc:title": "Business project", "dcterms:created": "2005-05-26T11:05:34Z"}
