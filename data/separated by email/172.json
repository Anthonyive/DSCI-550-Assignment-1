He deposited US$ 15.5 M  contained\nin 1 Trunk Box in the name of our son PETERS as\ncontaining family valuables.

This is the money he made from\nthe sale of Gold and diamonds during his time as the\nGeneral overseer.\nWe need your sincere assistance to move this funds out from the \nsecurity\ncompany IN EUROPE for investment\nin your country as we cannot invest here due to its\nnearess to our country and the war still going on\nthere.
