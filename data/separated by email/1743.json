Then after the death of my father, we decided to \nmove to the Republic of South Africa\nwhere he had deposited the money in the Security Company as family \nvaluables.\n\nSo, I decided to contact you to assist me to transfer this money out of \nSouth Africa because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to operate any \nbank account within South Africa. We have agreed to offer you 20% of the \ntotal sum for your assistance, 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that \nmay be incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for me and \nmy family to invest in your country.\n\nAll I want you to do is to furnish me with your full personal phone and fax \nnumbers for easy communication. You can contact me on the above Telephone \nnumber. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely \nconfidential.\n\nThanks and God bless as I await your reply.\nBest Regards,\nPETER MOYO\n(For Family).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWe've added lots of new goodies to MSN South Africa - visit us today! \nhttp://www.msn.co.za/\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1708", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"peter moyo\" <petermoyo1000@hotmail.com>", "peter moyo <petermoyo1000@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; format=flowed", "dc:subject": "PLEASE HELP MY FAMILY.", "dc:title": "PLEASE HELP MY FAMILY.", "dcterms:created": "2005-06-22T08:05:32Z"}
