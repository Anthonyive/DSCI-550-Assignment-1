We were married for eleven years without a child.\nHe died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death\nI decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which\nthe Bible is against.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.5 Million\nwith a Bank in Cote D lvoire. Presently this money is still in the custody\nof the Bank in Cote D lvoire.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight\nmonths due to cancer problem.
