I am married to Late\r\nherina bana of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in\r\nSudan for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were\r\nmarried for eleven years without a child.He died after a brief\r\nillness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were\r\nboth very devoted muslims.\r\n\r\nSince his death I too have been battling with both cancer and\r\nfibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited\r\nthe sum of $20 Million (Twenty  Million U.S. Dollars) with an\r\noversea private security and holding firm .\r\n\r\nPresently, this money is still with the private security and\r\nholding firm in Malaysia ,Asia. Recently, my Doctor told me that\r\nI would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem.\r\nThough what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my\r\n\r\n condition I decided to donate this fund to either a moslem organisation or\r\ndevoted muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to\r\n instruct here- in. I want this muslim organisation or individual to use this\r\n money in all sincererity to fund mosques, orphanages,widows and also propagating\r\nthe word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of\r\n\r\nthe holy Quran.\r\n\r\nThe holy Quran emphasized so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged\r\nme to take this bold step. I took this decision because I don\u30fbt have any child\r\n\r\n\r\nthat will inherit this money and my husband relatives are new Christians\r\n converts and I don\u30fbt want my husband\u30fbs hard earned money to be misused\r\n by people I call unbelievers.\r\n\r\nI don\u30fbt want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner.\r\nHence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death\r\nI will be with ALLAH the most beneficient and the most merciful. I don\u30fbt\r\nneed any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and\r\nthe presence of my\r\nhusband\u30fbs relatives around me always. I don\u30fbt want them to know about\r\nthis development.\r\n\r\nWith ALLAH all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply\r\nI shall give you the contact of the Security Company. I will also\r\nissue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original-\r\n\r\nbeneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Muslim community where\r\nyou reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life\r\nof a true devoted muslim worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to\r\nserve the ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness.\r\n\r\nPlease always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your\r\nreply will give me room in sourcing For a muslim organisation or a\r\ndevoted muslim for this same purpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams\r\n will rest squarely on your shoulders. May the almighty ALLAH continue\r\nto guide and protect you.\r\nReply me through this email address,aisha_hassan2000@yahoo.com\r\nRegards,\r\nMRS AISHA HASSAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1806", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "15", "dc:creator": ["\"MRS  ASIHA   HASSAN\" <asihahassan@walla.com> ", "MRS  ASIHA   HASSAN <asihahassan@walla.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" ", "dc:identifier": "<0MKuxu-1E6hL908SZ-0001U7@mx.perfora.net> ", "dc:subject": "PRAISE ALLAH, THE MOST BENEVOLENT", "dc:title": "PRAISE ALLAH, THE MOST BENEVOLENT", "dcterms:created": "2005-08-21T04:21:52Z"}
