I have\ndecided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial\nto both of us at the end of the transaction. \n\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on\nOctober 31st 1999 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account\nwith this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his\nfamily or relation before our discovery to this development. The said amount was\nU.S $25.2M (fifteen million two hundred thousand United States dollars) \n\nAs it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through\nthe SOUTH AFRICA chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here in\nJOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA. \n\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the\nbonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this\nmoney to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed\ninformation will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and\nwillingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business\nopportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my\nposition in this country as a civil servant (A Banker), we are not allowed to\noperate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during\nthe time of transfer because I work in this bank. \n\nThis is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who\nwill forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the\nBank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be\nre-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and\nclarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will\nbe remitted from to your own designation bank account. \n\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the\ntotal sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses\nthat may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 65%\nwill be for me and my partners. Please, you have been advised to keep \"top\nsecret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we\nconclude this deal with you. \n\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you\nconfirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and\nfurther investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to\ninvest in. All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear\nfrom you. \n\nI look forward to receive your immediate response through\nmy email: nath_marcus@yahoo.com\n \n\nYours faithfully, \n\nMR. Nathaniel Marcus.\n\n \n\nAUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION\nABSA BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA,\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1839", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Nathaniel Marcus<nath_marcus@yahoo.com>", "Nathaniel Marcus <nath_marcus@yahoo.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain", "dc:identifier": "<200509111229.j8BCTdsv026086@cs.CU> ", "dc:subject": "Invitation For Partnership ", "dc:title": "Invitation For Partnership ", "dcterms:created": "2005-09-11T14:29:25Z"}
