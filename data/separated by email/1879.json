A. E. I write you this proposal in\r\ngood faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.\r\nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the\r\nCHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at\r\nUS$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was\r\nmoved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on\r\nthe maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered.\r\nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum\r\nCorporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to\r\nhis country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans.\r\n\r\nOn further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser\u2019s family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he\r\ndid not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any\r\nWILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no\r\none have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not\r\naware of it, I am the only one that have the information.\r\nWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.\r\nBy end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of\r\nabove $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country\r\nimmediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain\r\nthe source of the money.\r\nI cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to\r\n\r\nlate Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of\r\nthe funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.\r\n\r\nAll documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under \r\na legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.\r\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are\r\ninterested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.\r\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal.\r\nI wait your urgent reply through my private email address: drateeq299@yahoo.com.au\r\nRegards,\r\nMr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1842", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["Dr Ateeq Rahman Khan <drrahman@luxmail.com>", "Dr Ateeq Rahman Khan <drrahman@luxmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1", "dc:identifier": "<20050914120208.9D33CC08E@krusty.si.UM>", "dc:subject": "BUSINESS PROPOSAL", "dc:title": "BUSINESS PROPOSAL", "dcterms:created": "2005-09-14T12:05:07Z"}
