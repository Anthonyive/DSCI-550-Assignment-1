Though I am\r\nvery rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile\r\nto people and only focused on my business as that was\r\nthe only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\r\nas I now know that there is more to life than just\r\nwanting to have or make all the money in the world.I\r\nbelieve when God gives me a second chance to come to\r\nthis world I would live my life a different way from\r\nhow I have lived it.\r\nNow that God has called me, I have willed and given\r\nmost of my property and assets to my immediate and\r\nextended family members as well as a few close\r\nfriends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my\r\nsoul so, I have decided to give alms to charity\r\norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last\r\ngood deeds I do on earth.\r\nSo far, I have distributed money to some charity\r\norganizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.\r\nNow that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot\r\ndo this myself anymore. I once asked members of my\r\nfamily to close one of my accounts and distribute the\r\nmoney which I have there to charity organization in\r\nBulgaria and Rwanda, they refused and kept the money\r\nto themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as\r\nthey seem not to be contended with what I have left\r\nfor them.\r\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge\r\ncash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I have\r\nwith a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want\r\nyou to help me collect this deposit and despatch it to\r\ncharity organizations.\r\nI have set aside 20% for you and for your time.\r\nPlease reply to my personal e.mail address ellisd@katamail.com\r\nGod be with you.\r\nDAVID ELLIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1872", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["DAVID ELLIS <ellisdav22@portafree.com>", "DAVID ELLIS <ellisdav22@portafree.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1", "dc:identifier": "<1127863399.4339d467affbc@imp3-g19.free.fr>", "dc:subject": "CHARITY", "dc:title": "CHARITY", "dcterms:created": "2005-09-27T23:23:19Z"}
