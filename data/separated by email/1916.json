I am\r\nMr. Ali Raza Khan, currently Head of Coporate affairs with a reputable bank\r\nhere in U. A. E.  I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I\r\ncan trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.\r\n\r\nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On\r\nNovember 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON\r\nPETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36\r\ncalendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred\r\nThousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before\r\nI was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his\r\naccount officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the\r\nmaturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the\r\nletter was returned undelivered.\r\n\r\nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned and\r\nfinally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation\r\nthat Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein\r\n(former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was\r\naccused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I\r\ndiscovered that Mr. Al Nasser\u2019s family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War\r\nin Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in\r\nall his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did\r\nnot leave any WILL.  This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under\r\ndormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the\r\nowner since 2003.  I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so\r\nfar, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support\r\nthe United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By end of this year,\r\nthe government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government\r\nauthority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source\r\nof the funds,making sure it is not for terrorism support.  If I do not move this money\r\nout of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely\r\nconfiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain\r\nthe source of the money.\r\n\r\nI cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why\r\nI am contacting you for an assistance.  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser, coupled\r\nwith my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Groug , I have\r\nthe power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next\r\nof kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall\r\ngive you.  All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and\r\nthere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate\r\narrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and\r\nanything goes.\r\n\r\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds\r\nin percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.  If you are interested, contact\r\nme as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over the details.  Thanking you in\r\nadvance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.  I shall send\r\nyou copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for\r\nyour perusal.\r\n\r\nI wait your urgent response.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Ali Raza Khan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1879", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr. Ali Raza Khan\" <ali200khan@yahoo.co.in> ", "Mr. Ali Raza Khan <ali200khan@yahoo.co.in>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<0MKv6A-1EMBNS2CJB-00069L@mx.perfora.net>", "dc:subject": "GREETINGS FROM U.A.E", "dc:title": "GREETINGS FROM U.A.E", "dcterms:created": "2005-10-02T21:28:04Z"}
