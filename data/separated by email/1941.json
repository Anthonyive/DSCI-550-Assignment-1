I did not\nwant the management of the Security Company to know the\ncontent of the consignments, therefore I registered the\ncontent of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security\ncompany believes that  what I deposited with them was Gold\nBars.\nI have notified the Security Company where I deposited the\nconsignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the\nconsignment abroad and the security company has since been\nwaiting for my authority for the consignment to leave my\ncountry and move to abroad.\n If you know that you handle .receive such big funds\nhonestly and wisely , then do contact me back first through\nthis my email:  Mrs.DiepreyeAlamieyeseigha@hotmail.com\nWe have set assude 20% percentage of the cash will be\nyour's after you receive the consignment/funds.
