I trained and work as an external auditor for the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) of Singapore. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because a late investor , who bears the same last name with you has left monies totaling a little over $10 million United States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and no next of kin has come forward all these years.\r\n\r\nBanking regulation legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing.I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, working with you,since you have the same last Name with the Late Investor, we can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I crave your participation and cooperation.\r\n\r\nI have seized all relevant information (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk .\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. I have intentionally left out the finer details for now until I hear from you. To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by email, stating your full names, date of birth, telephone number and fax number. I do expect your prompt response.\r\n\r\npls do contact me in my email address[fredr_andre@yahoo.com.sg].\r\nWaiting to hear from you soon.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nMr. Fredrick Andrew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1912", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr. Fredrick Andrew\" <fredr_andre@walla.com>", "Mr. Fredrick Andrew <fredr_andre@walla.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200510240632.j9O6Wrpj001369@panther.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "YOUR URGENT RESPONSE IS NEEDED", "dc:title": "YOUR URGENT RESPONSE IS NEEDED", "dcterms:created": "2005-10-24T06:33:02Z"}
