You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site(http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/)\nThe Governing Body of the bank has contacted me on this matter, based on the fact that his supposed next of kin, happened to die in the said crash and I am yet to provide any other Next of Kin to lay claim to the fund.\n\n\n\nUnder a clear and legitimate agreement with you, I shall seek your consent to be presented as the next of Kin,so that the proceeds of this account now valued US 4.1 million, will be paid to you, so that the Bank will not confiscate this fund, as the banking law and guidelines here stipulates \nthat if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund For the sake of transparency on this matter, you are free to make immediate contact with me through my mailbox or phone line, for further information related to this matter.\n\n\nThank you very much for your anticipated acceptance while I expect your\nprompt response.\n\n\nYours faithfully,\n\u00a0Barr, Felix Eze\nYou can contact me through my mailbox: felixeze123@yahoo.com for further information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1924", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"felixeze123\" <felixeze123@jubii.dk>", "felixeze123 <felixeze123@jubii.dk>"], "dc:format": "text/html; charset=\"windows-1252\"", "dc:identifier": "<77813821514605@lycos-europe.com>", "dc:subject": "URGENT REPLY NEEDED", "dc:title": "URGENT REPLY NEEDED", "dcterms:created": "2005-10-31T10:18:38Z"}
