Over-analysis often confuses the issue\r\nand in the end brings us\r\nno closer to insight. We sometimes become too busy\r\nclassifying, separating,\r\nand examining, to remember that love is easy. It's we\r\nwho make it\r\ncomplicated.

And when\r\ntwo souls that are destined to be together find each\r\nother, their streams of\r\nlight flow together, and a single brighter light goes\r\nforth from their\r\nunited being. Moreover,the man that love me will like\r\nmy brother the way he\r\nlove me.because that is the only happiness that i have\r\nnow.\r\nIt is the things in common that make relationships\r\nenjoyable, but it is the\r\nlittle differences that make them interesting. you can\r\ncall me in our church\r\nphone number 221525-87-24 the name of the Rev in\r\ngodwin,tell him. you what\r\nto speak with Violet.the days we can answer call\r\nare,tusday and friday time\r\n2.pm til 6pm.But before you call me, try and send me\r\nmail so that i can go\r\nand wait for your call\r\ni will tell you more in my next mail for your better\r\nunderstanding,i pray\r\nthat God should gurd you and give you more\r\nblessing.Because the fear of God\r\nis the begining of wisdom.I 'm a good believed,i\r\nalways pray to God to give\r\nme husband who will take me and my younger brother at\r\noff this mess.I have\r\nbe passing some hard time all this while,but i thank\r\nGod that i'm stil\r\nalive.someone need to pass some hard life to know are\r\nlife is all about.But\r\ni believe that God is going to take me at off this\r\nsorrow stress of mind\r\noneday What about you? tell me little about your self\r\nand your family\r\nwhat you hate in a woman and what you like in a woman?\r\nlooking forward to hear from you have a wonderful day.\r\nLinda Dickson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1941", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Miss Linda Dickson\" <Linda-2Dickson@yahoo.co.nz>", "Miss Linda Dickson <Linda-2Dickson@yahoo.co.nz>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200511081611.jA8GBUFa032306@flawless.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "My Dearest One,", "dc:title": "My Dearest One,", "dcterms:created": "2005-11-06T14:09:53Z"}
