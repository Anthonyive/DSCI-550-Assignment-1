Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to \nmake fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left \nwith no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my \nclient who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that \nhe and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an \nEgyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this \nfrom the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\n\nWEBSITE.\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.\n\nI am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.\nAccording to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to \nthe government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years \nof the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is \nto seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the \nlegacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his \nnext-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great \nconfidence in me.\n\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you \nand 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami \nvictims,\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a \ncodicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.\n\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for \nyou to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of \ngetting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity \nso as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of \nthe oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the \nsensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its \nconfidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with \nanybody, even if you decline my request.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours truly\n\nStephen Ayling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1985", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"STEPHEN AYLING\" <hayleypotter@msn.com>", "STEPHEN AYLING <hayleypotter@msn.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; format=flowed", "dc:subject": "PRPOSITION", "dc:title": "PRPOSITION", "dcterms:created": "2005-11-25T20:03:02Z"}
