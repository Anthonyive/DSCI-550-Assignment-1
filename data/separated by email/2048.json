Please permit me to make this\nplea to you and if interested, do not hesitate to get back to me via my email\nimmediately for further action.\n\nLast 4 years, a group of men from Africa were able to move the sum of $15M\n(Fifteen Million Dollars Only) to one of\u00a0our branch here in London and since then,\nnone of them have shown up to lay claims on the said amount.\n\nSeveral calls have been made to the owners and none was successful on the\nnumbers given and now I have all\nthe paper work to transfer the funds via our payment office in Berlize to\nyour account without any trace as all documents will be destroyed by me immediately\nthe transfer is taken place after 5 days of receiving your details.\n\nJust few days I discovered from the right source that the owner of this money\nis dead and I have gone through his file and have discovered that he has\nno Next of Kin to inherit his money. I want to use you as the Next of Kin\nto enable me transfer the funds ($15M) to your account immediately.\n\nPlease this is very confidential and must not be discussed with anyone else\nas I have prepared all my documents to effect the transfer to your account\nonce I have made all changes on the account. Also you will assure me that\nyou will not disappear with the funds hence I make this plea in good faith.I\nhave all the documents gotten from the Registry to put you in place as the\nNext of Kin.\n\nThe funds will be shared on 60-40 bases to avoid greed on both sides. If\nyou are interested, get back to me with your contacts now and we shall get\nthis done.\n\nPlease it is very important to send your response to my private email address:zankjamm@myway.com \n\u00a0\n\nYours faithfully,\nMr.Zivko Jannes\nLondon-England\nReply here only:zankjamm@myway.com\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2010", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"vski.ziv@virgin.net\" <vski.ziv@virgin.net> Yours faithfully,Mr.Zivko JannesLondon-EnglandReply here only:zankjamm@myw=", "vski.ziv@virgin.net <vski.ziv@virgin.net>"], "dc:format": "multipart/alternative;  with the funds hence I make this plea in good faith.I<BR>have all the docu=", "dc:identifier": "<228386.1133798129072.JavaMail.?@fh1006.dia.cp.net> accountonce I have made all changes on the account.
