After thedeath of my father,\r\nwe decided to move to the Republic of senegal dakar where\r\nhe had deposited the money inthe Security Company as\r\nvaluables.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to contact overseas firm and companiesa\r\nthat will assist me to move this money out of senegal\r\nbecause as asylum seekers we are not allowed to\r\noperate any bank account within senegal.
