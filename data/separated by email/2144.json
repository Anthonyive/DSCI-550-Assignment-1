I have decided to contact you on a business \ntransaction that will be very beneficial for both of us at the end of it.\n\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on \nOctober 31st 2002 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his \naccount with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either \nfrom his family or relatives before our discovery to this development.\n\nThe said amount was U.S $22.2M (twenty two million two hundred thousand \nUnited States dollars).\n\nAs it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through \nthe Burkina-faso chamber of foreign relations here in Ouagadougou \nBurkina-faso.\n\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the \nbonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer \nthis money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and \nneeded information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your \ninterest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this \ngreat business opportunity.\n\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \ncountry as a civil servant(As a Banker),we are not allowed to operate a \nforeign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the \ntime of transfer because I work in this bank.\n\nThis is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who \nwill forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to \nthe Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to \nbe re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification \nand clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole \nmoney will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.\n\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On \nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone \nbills, while 60% will be for me . Please, you have been adviced to keep \n\"TOP-SECRET\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service \nafter we conclude this deal .\n\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \nand  further  investment, either in your country or any country you advice \nme  to invest in.\n\nAll other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.if \nyou are really sure of your integrity reply me immediately or you call me on \nmy mobile phone .\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDr Ibrahim Bello.\n00226-76-441-987.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDon't just search.
