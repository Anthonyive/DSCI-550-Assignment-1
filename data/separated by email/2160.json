As a result of this explanation, the box was accepted for safe-keeping by the security company without  inspection.\r\n\r\nWhen the political situation in Freetown, Sierra Leone worsened, I escaped into Accra , Ghana and had since contacted the security company, identified  myself properly and informed them about the sad fate my father had suffered. I presented the lodgment\r\ndocuments and they confirmed that they have the trunk  box in their vault.\r\n\r\nSo I informed them that I intend initiating contacts with my fathers overseas partner who owns the consignment so that he can come and take delivery of it.\r\n\r\nMy decision to retrieve this box, transfer the money and start a new life forms\r\nthe basis of this enquiry from you.\r\n\r\n1) Could you assist me with the logistics and a good personal/company bank account through which I can retrieve the consignment out he security company\r\nand transfer this money out of Ghana ?\r\n\r\n2) Could you advise me on a good business proposition into which I can invest this money so that it would yield good dividends\r\n\r\n3) Could you assist me obtain resident papers in your country so that I can continue my education there from where I stopped.\r\n\r\nI sincerely will agree to any suitable percentage you may request for your assistance to me.\r\n\r\nI shall prefer most of our communication to be done via phone. I need not inform you that this matter is strictly confidential. I want you to treat it as such.\r\n\r\nGod will surely bless you in abundance as you made up your heart to help an orphan like me.\r\n\r\nNelson Williams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2122", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Nelson Williams\" <nelson_williams01@msn.com>", "Nelson Williams <nelson_williams01@msn.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200601270314.k0R3EQqn006883@snitch.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "PLEASE  HELP", "dc:title": "PLEASE  HELP", "dcterms:created": "2006-01-27T03:14:14Z"}
