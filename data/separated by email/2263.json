I don't want you to misunderstand this offer in any aspect, if it \nis okay with you I ask for your full cooperation. I am Yuri Konovalov, the General Director of Novokuibyshersk Oil an international affiliate \nof Yukos Oil and Gas Company based in Russia. Due to ill Health I have \nesophageal cancer, it has defiled all forms of medical treatment and \naccording to the medical experts it is a terminal illness so I do not \nknow how much longer I have to live. \n\n\nI never had any real Friends in my lifetime because I never really \ncared for anyone but my business. But now I know that there is more to life \nthan making all the money in the world. However, certain unfolding \nevents has made it very necessary for me to seek your help, my company is \nfighting investigations and bankruptcy due to the Yukos Oil problems in \nRussia, most of my assets were seized due to this case.\nRecently I received a bulk payment from South Africa Ministry for my \nlast contract there. I instructed them specifically not to send the funds \nto Russia because of the problems, but that the funds to be deposited \nwith a Finance and Security company in Europe on hold. A huge cash \ndeposit of Twenty-Five Million dollars was domiciled with a finance/Security \nCompany overseas to my knowledge only. This is the last of my assets, \nnow that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself \nanymore, I therefore \n need you as a partner because you are a neutral \nparty to help me collect this funds deposited with the security company and \ndisburse it secretly based on instructions. \n\n\nBecause my time is short I have decided to give most of this money to \ncharity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I \ndo on earth. For all your good efforts you will receive 30% of the \nFunds and must disburse the rest based on instructions. I want you to \nunderstand my seriousness in this case and if you can\nhandle the job kindly contact me on this email(y_konovalov@yahoo.com)\nfor security purposes. I have all the necessary documents on hand; \nplease contact me ASAP so we can discuss more. \n\n\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation. If you are not interested, \nplease keep it to yourself and do not respond.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\u00a0\n\nYuri Konovalov\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2225", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"y_konovalov\" <y_konovalov@jubii.dk>", "y_konovalov <y_konovalov@jubii.dk>"], "dc:format": "text/html; charset=\"windows-1252\"", "dc:identifier": "<183082891412551@lycos-europe.com>", "dc:subject": "RESPOND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP", "dc:title": "RESPOND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP", "dcterms:created": "2006-02-19T07:57:56Z"}
