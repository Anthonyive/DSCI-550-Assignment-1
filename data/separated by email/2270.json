I am (ASITA ALI)a senior\nstaff in file\ndepartment in African developent bank (ADB).I got your\ncontact from a Yahoo Tourist Search.\n\n\nWhen i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of\nyour capability\nand reliability to champion this businees opportunity when\ni prayed to\nGod or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum\nof $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an\naccount that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with\nhis entire family in (friday december 26,2003\u00a0 ) in a plane crash. Since we\ngot information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin\nto come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as\nindicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness\n  proposal to you and release the money to\nyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and\nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u2019t\nwant this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such\nmoney remained unclamed after five years, the money will be\ntransfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We\nagree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for\n;me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit\nyour country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.\n\n\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account\nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective\ncommunication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt\nof your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the\napplication I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required\narrangements have been made for the transfer.\n\n\nYou should contact me on my number 00226 76 52 47 43\nimmediately as soon\nas you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you\nimmediately.\n\n\nYour\u2019s faithfully,\nALI ASITA \n\n\nPOST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to\nenable the\ntransfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will\nprove to the\nbank.As you finished reading this letter call me\nimmediately so that we\ndiscuss very well over this business.Please call me and\ninform me that you\nreceived my mail, because i don't go to net always.\n.........................................................................................\n\n Sexy Like Us : Tu veux savoir si tu as la cote ?
