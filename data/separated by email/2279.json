He actually\nmade a numbered time (fixed)deposit valued at\nUS$112,000,000.00 \n(One Hundred and Twelve million united states dollars),for\ntwelve calendar \nmonths in my bank.The funds was actually meant for a project\nour late client wanted to start\nin the near future (a multi million Dollar\nsteel plant in Canada),\nI sent a routine notification to his forwarding\naddress but\ngot no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we\ndiscovered\nthat Mr.Cosban died from an automobile accident with his entire\nfamily .On further investigation, I\nfound out that he died without making a\nWill, and all attempts to trace\nhis next of kin was fruitless. I therefore\nmade further investigation\nand discovered that Mr. Cosban did not declare any\nnext of kin or\nrelations in all his official documents,including his Bank\nDeposit\npaperwork in our Bank.\nUpon this discovery, I now seek your\npermission to have you stand as a\nnext of kin to the deceased as all\ndocumentations will be carefully\nworked out by me for the funds to be\nreleased in your favour as the\nbeneficiary's next of kin.
