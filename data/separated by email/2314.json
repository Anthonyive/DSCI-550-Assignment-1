From Richard Ohene,\n\nBefore I introduce myself, I \nwish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you \nto treat it with seriousness. This letter must come to you as a big \nsurprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become \ngreat friends and business partners. \nMy name is Richard Ohene, the \npresent branch Manager of a bank here in Ghana. I write you this \nproposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the \ninformation I am about to reveal to you. Like I said,\nI have a \ntransaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is \nrequired as a foreigner. \n\nI use to head the Accounts department in my \nbank head office, but last December I was asked to take position of a \nManager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became \nthe present Manager and\ndiscovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I \ndiscovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has \nnot been operated on for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I \nfound out that this account\nbelongs to one Late Mr. ANDREAS SCHRANNER a \nGerman great industrialist and a resident of Munich, who unfortunately \nlost his life along with his entire famillies in the plane crash of \nCONCORDE AIRLINE\n[Flight AF4590 ] which crashed on 25TH JULY, 2000. You \nshall read more news about the crash on visiting this site, which I got \nduring my investigation; <http://news.bbc.co.\nuk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm>. \nThe account is escrow call account, \na secret type of account in my bank and no other person knows about \nthis account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other \nbeneficiary. I have kept a close\nmonitoring of the account since then \nand nobody has come forward to ask about the money as next of kin to \nthe late Mr. Andreas Schranner, meaning that no one is aware of the \naccount. I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a \nforeigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to \nclaim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, \nI have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner \nthat comes up as the next\nof kin to the account, with the correct \ninformation concerning the account, which I shall give you.\n\nI am \nseeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the \naccount, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. \nThere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be\nexecuted \nunder a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of \nlaw. \n\nThanking you in advance and may God bless,\n\nRichard Ohene\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2276", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Richard Ohene <richard_ohene1@virgilio.it>", "Richard Ohene <richard_ohene1@virgilio.it>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=\"UTF-8\"", "dc:subject": "From Richard Ohene", "dc:title": "From Richard Ohene", "dcterms:created": "2006-03-01T15:28:12Z"}
