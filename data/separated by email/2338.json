It has \ndefiled all forms of medical treatment,\nand right now I have only about \na few months to live, according to\nmedical  experts. I have not \nparticularly lived my life so well, as I\nnever really cared for anyone \n(not even myself)but my business. Though I am\nvery rich,  I was never \ngenerous, I was always hostile to people and\nonly focused on my \nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for.But now I\nregret all \nthis as I now know that there is more to life than just\nwanting to have \nor make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me\na \nsecond  chance to come to this world I would live my life a different\nway from how I have lived it.\n\nNow that God has called me, I have \nwilled and given most of my property\nand assets to my immediate and \nextended family members as well as few\nclose friends .I want God to be \nmerciful to me and accept my soul so, I\nhave decided to give alms to \ncharity organizations, as I want this to\nbe one of the last good deeds \nI do on earth. So far, I have Distributed\nmoney  to some charity \norganizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and\nMalaysia. Now that my health \nhas deteriorated so badly, I cannot do\nthis myself anymore.\n\nI  once \nasked members of my family to close one of my accounts and\ndistribute \nthe money which I have there to charity organization in\nBulgaria and \nPakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves.\nHence, I do \nnot trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended\nwith  what I \nhave left for them. The last of my money which no one\nknows of is the \nhuge cash deposit of Thirty Million United States\nDollars\n($30,000,000,00) that I have with a Finance Vaulting Unit\nAbroad. I \nwill want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it\nto  \ncharity organizations.\n\nN/B:\nKindly note that 35% of this funds must go \nto the tsunami victims,60%\nto other Charity Organization and 5% for \nyour effort and time.\nI cannot talk with you on the phone due to my \nhealth situation, as I am\nusing my Lap Top Computer to communicate with \nyou. You should respond\nto (gat_butu111@myway.com) if you are \ninterested in carrying out\nthis assignment on my behalf.\nGod be with \nyou.\n\nMr. Gat  Butu.\n\nEmail:gat_butu111@myway.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2300", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["mr gat butu <gat_butu@virgilio.it>", "mr gat butu <gat_butu@virgilio.it>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=\"UTF-8\"", "dc:subject": "FROM:MR GAT", "dc:title": "FROM:MR GAT", "dcterms:created": "2006-03-06T08:40:11Z"}
