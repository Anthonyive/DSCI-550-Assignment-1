I am the credit AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING \n\nUNIT,BANK OF AFRICA,COTONOU-BENIN REPBLIC. I am contacting you of a \n\nbusiness \n\ntransfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know \n\nthat a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and \n\nworried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off, \n\nand all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you \n\ndue to the urgency of this transaction. \n\nPROPOSITION; I am the account officer of a foreigner named Gerald Welsh \n\nwho died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 \n\nin an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can \n\nconfirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD \n\nNEWS. \n\nWEBSITE. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm Since his \n\ndeath, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money \n\nas his heir, because they all died in the same accident himself and his \n\nwife(May their soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his \n\naccount unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the \n\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. \n\nUpon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a \n\nnext of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully \n\nworked out by me for the funds (USD 10,700,000.00) to be released in \n\nyour \n\nfavor as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after four years the \n\nmoney will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and \n\nthe \n\nmoney shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i \n\ndecided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of \n\nkin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to \n\nshare \n\nthis money amongst themselves at the end of the year. \n\nIt may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an \n\norder of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please \n\nacknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual \n\nbusiness \n\nendeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are \n\ninterested. \n\n1.A Beneficiary name. In order for me to prepare the document for \n\ntransfer of the funds in your name. 2. Direct Telephone and fax \n\nnumbers. For \n\nour personal contact and mutual trust in each other. \n\nI shall be compensating you with [3million Million Dollars) \n\non final conclusion of this project for your assistance, while the \n\nbalance of 5 Million Dollars shall be for me for investment purposes. \n\nBecause I intend to retire after the conclusion of this transaction. \n\nIf this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me \n\nimmediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed \n\nin \n\nyou, I await your urgent reply. to this address: james221_2006@yahoo.com \n\nRegards, \n\nJAMES   \n\n- frankholding_7 holding\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2402", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["frankholding_7 holding <frankholding_7@yahoo.ca> the same accident himself and his <br><br>wife(May their soul rest in pe=", "frankholding_7 holding <frankholding_7@yahoo.ca>"], "dc:format": "text/html; charset=iso-8859-1", "dc:identifier": "<20060405024714.73473.qmail@web38311.mail.mud.yahoo.com> of a huge sum of money from a deceased account.
