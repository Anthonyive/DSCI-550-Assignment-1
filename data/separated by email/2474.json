I obtained your email from the internet,while\nsearching for a reliable person, who could assist us in receiving cash gift\nfrom contractors awarded contracts executed under the current budgetary\nallocation for NDDC. These bills had been approved for payment by the concerned\nministry. The contracts had been executed and commissioned. What we are about to\nreceive now, is a promised cash gift from the contractors whom we have helped\nduring the process of obtaining the contracts and in the processing of their\npayments. On our part, all modalities had been worked out in ensuring a smooth\nconclusion of the transfer to you within the next twenty one days. All I want\nfrom you is your details to enable these foreign contractors forward the cash\ngift to you on our behalf, because as government officials we cannot collect\nthese cash gift directly from them, neither are we allowed by law to\noperate/run a foreign accounts. If you are trustworthy and can assist me in\nreceiving these cash gift, I will like you to provide immediately to me, your\nfull names, address, and telephone number. Please note that there will be no\nfinancial obligation required from you and this transaction is risk free. For\neach cash you receive on our behalf, you will be entitled to 10% of that sum.\nAs soon as you indicate your interest, further instructions will be passed on\nto you on the procedure that we will follow in accomplishing this deal. Kindly\nreach me immediately via my confidential e-mail benjaminsalako@netscape.net\nfurnishing me with your details as stated above. Looking forward to hearing\nfrom you. Best regards, Mr.Benjamin Salako\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2436", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["BENJAMIN SALAKO <bensa1@k.ro>", "BENJAMIN SALAKO <bensa1@k.ro>"], "dc:format": "text/html;", "dc:identifier": "<20060417142040.xmt6jatmecs08wc0@70.103.140.109>", "dc:subject": "Representative Needed", "dc:title": "Representative Needed", "dcterms:created": "2006-04-17T20:20:40Z"}
