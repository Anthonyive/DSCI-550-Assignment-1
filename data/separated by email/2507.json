I\nwould respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail private and\nalso to kindly respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result\nof this email. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with certain facts\nthat I believe would be of interest to you.\n\nIn 2001, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/958/042/0500 came to our bank to engage\nin business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He\ninformed us that he had a financial portfolio of 15.37 million United States\nDollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the\nofficer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties\nas the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services\nepartment,especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.\nWe met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however\nI encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The\nfavored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600\ntraditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternative\ninvestments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities\nand made attractive margins for our first months of operation,the accrued profit\nwith interest included, stood at this point at over 16.2 million United States\nDollars,this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low\nrisk guaranteed returns on investments.In mid 2002, he asked that the money be\nliquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash\npayments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited\nwith a firm in Europe. I informed him that our bank would have to make special\narrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the\nbank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking\nand statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around\nwhen I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.\n\nCash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of\n9/11. I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainland\nEurope, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise\ninstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security\nconsultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits\nfrom high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable\nproducts or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This\nsmall and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly\nplaced and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money\nwas deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had,\nthis transpired aroundbFebruary 25th 2003. In June last year, we got a call\nfrom the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular\nportfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the\nfact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about\nthe deposit, and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his\ndeposit.\n\nI made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating\nhim to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead, a person who\nsuited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of\nFrance; we were soon enough able to gather more information and the cause of\ndeath was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into\npossible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come\nforward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs,\nthose who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels\nof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means\nno one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name;\ndepositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also\ngives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the\nbank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said,\nrarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not\nnominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in\nthis case; he died Intestate.\n\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we\ninstituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have\nright to claim the estate, this investigation for several months were futile.\nWe have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate\ncompanies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that\nresulted in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being\nas a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the estate\neven if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the deceased).My\nofficial capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the\ninvestigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation.\nWhat this means, with you being a foreigner, I have considered the fact that\nour dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This\nleaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing\nsituation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the\ndeposit. According to practice, the firm shall by the end of this financial\nyear broadcast a request for statements of claim to our bank, failing to\nreceive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to our\nbank.This will result in the money entering our bank's accounting system and\nthe portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services\nDepartment. This will not happen if I have my way.\n\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking world who\nfinds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of\nprivate banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy\ncertain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you should have begun by now to\nput together the general direction of what I propose. There is USD$\n15,991,674(Thirteen million, nine hundred and ninety one thousand, six hundred\nand seventy four united states dollars) deposited, I alone have the deposit\ndetails and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do\nso.\n\nI alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm is\nconcerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the\nfunds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just\ncustomer services and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what's\nthe history or nature of the deposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to\nrelease the deposit to any party that comes forward, and this is the situation.\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of the\ndeceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family but\nhowever the investigation has officially come to an end.\n\nMy proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is\ngiven to the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as the\nclosest surviving relation/associate, and all etiquette shall be done in\naccordance with the rule of law, I certainly can guarantee you that. By the\ncommon law,the power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of the\nlaw, and this power has been extended to all a man's Personal and Real estate\n(Personalty & Realty). There is no ruling which prevents an inheritance from\nbeing so exhausted by legacies as to render it unworthy of the heir's\nacceptance; basically all persons of sound mind are competent to bequeath and\ndevise real and personal estate, excepting infants, with all this I would say\nwe have the clear advantage to carry out a smooth and perfect operation whereby\nthe paper work shall be coordinated in such a way that your status as a sole\nbeneficiary is confirmed. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share\nthe money with you in half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as\nthe next of kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share\nthe proceeds 50/50.\n\nI would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have\ndrawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, but on\nthe other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner would easily pass as the\nbeneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have the\ndeposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the\nfinal closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then officially\ncommunicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit\nto you; with these two things: all is done.The alternative would be for us to\nhave the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder, this\nway there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm.\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the consequences\nof this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in this project that\nyou should discard this mail. I ask also, that you do not be vindictive or\ndestructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget\nI ever contacted you; please not destroy my career because you do not approve of\nmy proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums\nout of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a\ncriminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard\nfor you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this\nmove. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let\nthis chance pass me by and I hope you understand,because for once I found\nmyself in total control and face to face with my destiny. These chances won't\npass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with\nme please let me know, and hence move on with my life, but do not destroy me; I\nam a family man and this is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities.\nThere is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I\nhave evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to\nwork with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who knows of this\nsituation,good fortune will bless you and plant you into the center of\nrelevance in my life, let?s share the blessing.\n\nIf you find yourself interested to work with me,please contact me specifically,\nthrough this email account mrqinwang1954@netscap.net if you give me positive\nsignals, I will initiate this process towards a quick conclusion.It is\nnecessary to inform you that under no condition should you contact me via\nofficial channels; I will simply deny knowing you and about this project. I\nrepeat, I do not want you contacting me through our official lines neither do I\nwant you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only\nthrough this email address above; I do not want any direct link between you and\nme. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to\nassess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management\npolicy, please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a\nfamily man; I happily married with kids, I send you this mail not without a\nmeasure of fear as to what the consequences might be, but I know within me that\nnothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy\nor on a platter of gold,this is the one truth I have learned from my private\nbanking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord I\nshall have the pleasure of meeting you, after this task has been completed we\ncan plan a meeting.\n\nI await your response.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nQin Wang\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2469", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["wang qin <mrqinwang1954@netscape.net>", "wang qin <mrqinwang1954@netscape.net>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;", "dc:identifier": "<20060425111930.u6oqvet41534004c@72.9.254.91>", "dc:subject": "honestly ok", "dc:title": "honestly ok", "dcterms:created": "2006-04-25T16:19:30Z"}
