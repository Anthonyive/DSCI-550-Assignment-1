My colleagues have\r\nassigned me to seek for assistance of a reliable foreigner through whom we can transfer the\r\nsum of US $65,500,000.00 (sixty Five Million, five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) which\r\narose from deliberate over- inflated contract value for the General expansion of the Kanji\r\nDam Thermal Station on behalf of National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) for increased\r\nenergy generation to Nigeria and some other West African Countries. The Contract was\r\nawarded in 1998 during the late General Sanni Abacha regime to an expatriate firm with the\r\nconsideration of 10% commission agreement on the total contract value. The contract has\r\nbeen completed and the contractor has long been paid, we are now left with this\r\nUS$65,500,000.00 representing the 10% our own share as agreed presently in the Federal\r\nGovernment account. The favorable political/economic climate in this country now presented\r\nan opportunity for this money to be transferred out of the country. I got your contact from a\r\ncommercial attached to your emabassy. This assurance gave me courage to link you up for\r\nthis particular transaction, and I hope it will be of mutual benefit to all of us. Our contact in\r\nthe Federal Ministry of Finance have given us a go a head advice to begin the process of the\r\nremittance, hence we have set in motion the machinery for the take off of the transaction and\r\nfurther action will commence immediately we hear from you. We have agreed that after the\r\ntransfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 30% of the total amount\r\ntransferred, 10% for incidental expenses from you and us, while the remaining 60% will be\r\nfor us. We decided to give you this percentage in order to motivate you and also to let you\r\nfeel satisfied at the end of this transaction. The nature of your business is not particularly\r\nrelevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate\r\nand assurance that our own share will be given to us when this money is transferred into your\r\naccount. All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a no risk situation on the sides\r\nof both parties and it is believed that the conclusion of this transaction will not last more than\r\nfourteen (14) working days. However, we are going to retrieve the whole documents that will\r\nbe related to this transaction so that both parties will be protected after the transfer of the\r\nmoney into your account. Since we have no knowledge of business, our plan is to invest this\r\nmoney into Real Estate, Stocks and we can also invest in some other profitable business in\r\nyour country based on your advice because many of our years has been spent as Civil\r\nServant, and we may likely resign from government service to private businesses after this\r\nmoney is transferred into your Account. Please note that this business is strictly confidential\r\nand must not be disclosed to a third party. This is necessary to avoid disclosure that may\r\njeopardize the transaction. Finally, if this proposal is acceptable to you or if you have any\r\nquestions, feel free to contact me on the above E-mail address. You should also send to me\r\nyour private telephone / fax numbers and E-mail address for easy and confidential\r\ncommunication. I will oblige you with further information if so required.
