In \r\nfact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in \r\nthis country as civil servant,I am not allowed to operate a foreign \r\naccount and that would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during \r\nthe time of transfer since I still work in this bank, this is the \r\nactual reason why I required a second party or fellow who will assist \r\nme forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an \r\nexisting bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to \r\nreceive this fund, even an empty a/c can also serve for this purpose.\r\n\r\nOn smooth conclusion of this transaction,55% of the fund will be for me,\r\nI will give you 30% of the total transfered sum,10% for charity both in \r\nSenegal and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to \r\nsettle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.\r\nWhat I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I \r\nhave in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully \r\naccomplish the operation.Bear in mind that this transaction is 100% \r\nrisk free.\r\nFurther Information will be given to you as soon as I \r\nreceive your positive response.\r\n\r\nPLEASE,THE CONTENT OF THIS LETTER IS A \r\nTOP SECRET AND I WILL WANT YOU TO KEEP IT TO YOURSELF ONLY.\r\n\r\nSincerely \r\nyours,\r\n\r\nMr. Maree Jacko.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2501", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Jacko Maree <j_maree2000@virgilio.it>", "Jacko Maree <j_maree2000@virgilio.it>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=\"UTF-8\"", "dc:subject": "I need your help", "dc:title": "I need your help", "dcterms:created": "2006-05-03T20:17:45Z"}
