James Ubaru,\nDepartment of \nBudget/Planning,\nPetroleum Ministry,\nNigeria.\nEmail:jauba3206@yahoo.com\nTel: \n+2348028314081\n\nYour candid \nattn:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS \nPROPOSAL.\n\nCompliment of the day to you. We have a \nbusiness proposal for you. This is after due deliberation with my partners. \nWe believe that you would be in a position to work with us in our bid to \ntransfer the sum of Forty-one Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States \nDollars (US$10.8M) into\u00a0your account since you do not live in our \nCountry.\u00a0 This transaction\u00a0is 100% legal and no risk involved. \n\n\nWe are members of the special committee for budget and planning of \nthe Ministry of Petroleum. This committee is principally concerned with \ncontract appraisals and approval of contracts in order of priorities as \nregards CAPITAL PROJECTS of the Federal Government of Nigeria. With our \npositions, we have successfully secured for ourselves the sum of Forty-one \nMillion, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars(US$41.5M). \n\nWe \nare working with the present Democratically elected Government in my \ncountry, and we are seeking the support of Foreign Government to win the \nnext election coming up in the year 2007, which the race has started. So \nthey have given directive to all Federal Parastatals to settle all Foreign \nContractors being owed for contract that they have done. Therefore, our plan \nis to include your name as one of the contractors being owed in our \ncorporation. \n\nWhat we need from you is to provide a safe Account into \nwhich the funds will be transferred since Government Officials in my country \nare not allowed by our laws to Operate Foreign Accounts. It has been agreed \nthat you will be compensated with US$8.3 Million of the remitted funds. \nUS$31.125Million belongs to us, while\u00a0 US$2.075Million will be set \naside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes. \n\nIt may \ninterest you to know that two years ago a similar transaction was carried \nout with one Mr. Patrice Miller, the C.E.O of Crane International Trading \nCorporation at number 135, East 57th street, 28th floor, New York 10022, \nwith Telephone (212)308-7788 and Telex Number 6731689. After the agreement \nbetween both of us in which he was to take 25% of the money as his share, \nthe money was duly transferred into his Account. We were disappointed on our \narrival in New York as we were reliably informed that Mr. Patrice Miller was \nno longer on that address while his Telephone and Telex Numbers have been \nreallocated to somebody else. That was how we lost US$27.5M to Mr.Patrice \nMiller.\n\nThis time around we would not want you to be like that. We \nneed a more reliable and trustworthy person and a reputable Company to do \nthis business with, hence we contacted you. So if you can prove yourself to \nbe trusted and interested in this deal then we are prepared to do business \nwith you. What we want from you is the assurance that you will let us have \nour share when this amount of US$41.5M is transferred into your \naccount.\n \n\nIf this proposal satisfies you, please contact us, so we can advice \nyou on the modalities of the transaction. All modalities of this transfer, \nhave been worked out and once started will not take more than 7 Banking days \nwith the absolute support of all concerned. This transaction is 100% safe \nand risk free now and after the transfer. Kindly treat this as urgent and \nvery confidential. Direct all reponses to jauba3206@yahoo.com\n\nRegards,\nEngr.
