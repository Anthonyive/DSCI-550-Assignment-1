DR AMIRI BABO\nBILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER\nFOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.\nBANK  OF AFRICA(B.O.A)\nOUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO\n\n\n\nDear Friend,\n\nI am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department \nBANK\nOF AFRICA .\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$25M US dollars \n(Twenty five Million  US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our \nforeign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2002 in a \nplane crash.\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next if \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \nplane crash leaving\nnobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money will be released  to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed bill.\n\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed bill. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \nbusiness is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nI  propose  that 30% of this money will be for you as my  foreign partner, \nin respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for \nexpenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me. Thereafter I \nwill visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages \nindicated.\n\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, \nyou must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased \nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your  private telephone \nand fax number for easy and effective communication and  location wherein \nthe money will be remitted.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by e-mail a  text of the \napplication which you'll fill in and send to the bank's email address.. I \nwill not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free \nand that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required \narrangements have been made for the transfer.\n\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for \nfurther clearifications.\n\nYours faithfully,\n.
