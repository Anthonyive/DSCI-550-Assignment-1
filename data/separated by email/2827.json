The funds I intend to invest with you are currently in a UAE bank\r\n\r\nhere as was deposited by my late father who worked before he died as a chemical engineer in\r\n\r\nthe Saudi Oil Corporation ARAMCO and later the Emirate National Oil Corporation ENOC.\r\n\r\nMy reason of trying to establish my own business is necessitated by the advent of my divorce\r\n\r\nsuit with my husband and according to the sharjah marital law here, if my husband family\r\n\r\ngets any knowledge of the funds in the bank, they will take possession of the funds since my\r\n\r\nfather used my name as the next of kin.\r\n\r\nIt is my wish to handle this matter privately under the most cautious legal arrangement to\r\n\r\nget the funds into your possession before we can commence any trade deal and therefore\r\n\r\ndemand that you kindly give me a brief information about you with pictures, contact address\r\n\r\nand telephone numbers incase I want to call you .\r\nthe money in question (US$9,750,000) was deposited into the bank about two years back before\r\n\r\nmy father died of heart failure and ever since his death, my relationship with my husband\r\n\r\nhas gone bad hence my decision to file for the divorce amongst other reasons which I shall\r\n\r\nlet you know\r\nA friend of mine advised that what we shall do is to portray you as an investor who has\r\n\r\ngiven that money to my father before he died for a crude oil lifting from the Saudi oil\r\n\r\ncorporation but the deal was thwarted due to the sudden death of my father.\r\nBy this strategy, hire the services of a lawyer here who will secure a letter of\r\n\r\nadministration notarized by the high court with a sworn affidavit of change of ownership and\r\n\r\napplication to the bank for the release of the funds to you under the emirate inheritance\r\n\r\nlaw. This logistics is to get the funds transferred to you as the bonafide owner of the\r\n\r\nfunds to avoid any implications that will not permit me as being married to the royal family\r\n\r\nto possess such chattel or estate of my late father in conformity with the sharia marital\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\nSo I hope you understand very well, the strategies and where you don\u2019t quite comprehend, do\r\n\r\nask me for more clarifications and for your involvement I will pay you 15% of the total\r\n\r\nmoney for your consultancy and then we can invest the rest still under your supervision.
