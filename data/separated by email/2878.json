My late husband died during the out brake of the recent civil war in Sudan.\r\nBefore his death, he held many important offices which includes being the prime minister in a coalition government between 1986 to 1989. He also was the leader of the Umma Party a strong political organization in Sudan. After his tenure as coalition prime minister, he was made to be in-charge of the payment of Sudanese Media communications department in 2001.\r\nMy husband was killed by a group known as Sadiq al Mahdi at the on set of the civil war while fighting for the liberation of the Sudanese people from the hands of a dictatorship government.! I am 41 years old now and seriously ill although I am now receiving treatment in a hospital here in Thailand. During the period of our marriage we were blessed with a male child by name Mr. Minja John Hinga, who is here taking care of me.\r\nAfter the death of my husband, I inherited a huge amount of money ( US$5.5million US dollars) which my late husband deposited with a Security Company in Thailand for safe keeping. I decided to contact you to assist me and my son to claim this money from where it was deposited and probably guide us in investing the fund in a worthwhile flourishing business over there. I hereby ask for your help and assistance.\r\nAlthough I am a novice in business, I have an eye on real estates properties. Your advice on other areas of private sector will be highly appreciated. I believe that you would be of great help in guiding my son to a successful business investment in your country even when I am gone.\r\nI will appreciate if you will show interest in collaborating! with us, as this transaction will benefit both of us on joint venture partnership. Furthermore I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage cash reward for your assistance. Detailed information on other proceedings will be made available to you upon receiving your reply showing interest in collaborating with us as I look forward to your urgent reply. We may need your personal telephone numbers for more information.\r\nSincerely Yours,\r\nMrs. Janet Garang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2840", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"MRS.
