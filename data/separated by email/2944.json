However, this\ncorrespondence is unofficial and private, \nand it should be treated as\nsuch. \n\nAt first I will like to assure you \nthat this transaction is 100% risk\nand trouble free to both parties. WE \nWANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM\nOUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR \nTRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE\nOWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, \na program leader.Until his\ndeath,The Late Prime\nMinister, Mr. Rafik \nHariri, has a huge investment here in the United\nKingdom and all over \nthe world, as a matter of fact he has the sum\nof(THIRTY SIX MILLION \nSEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS\nSTERLINGS) in his account \nhere in London which he deposited as a\nfamily valuables.The family do \nnot know about this deposit.I was on a\nroutine inspection that I \ndiscovered a dormant domiciliary account\nwith a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX \nMILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE\nTHOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on \nfurther discreet investigation, I also\ndiscovered that the account \nholder has passed away (dead) leaving no\nbeneficiary to the account. \nThe bank will approve this money to any\nforeigner because the former \noperator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am\ncertainly sure that nobody \nwill come again for the claim of this\nmoney. A foreigner can only claim \nthis money with legal claims to the\naccount Holder, \n\nTherefore I need \nyour cooperation in this transaction. I will provide\nall necessary \ninformation needed in order to claim this money.Hoping\nin God that you \nwill never let me down now and in future.o.k!
