The said amount was sum of $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED \nTHOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3m)\n\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the \nBonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer \nthis money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and \nneeded information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your \ninterest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this \ngreat business opportunity.\n\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \nto the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money \nto be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification \nand clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole \nmoney will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don't \nwant this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.Our Banking \nlaw and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed \nafter five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as \nunclaimed fund.The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is \noccasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe \ncannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On \nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \ntotal sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of \nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone \nbills, while 65% will be for me. Please, you have been adviced to keep \"top \nsecret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I \nconclude this deal with you.\n\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \nto invest in.\n\nAll other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from \nyou.\nI look forward to receive your email.\n\nYours faithfully,\nMr NABA MOHAMMED HOME ADDRESS:288 QUEAZIN\nFERDINAND AVENUE OUAGADOUGOU\nBURKINA-FASO.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTen : profite de ton Messenger en illimit\u00e9 sur ton mobile !  \nhttp://mobile.live.fr/messenger/ten/\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2909", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "2", "dc:creator": ["MR NABA MOHAMMED", "naba mohammed <naba_moha06@hotmail.fr>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed", "dc:identifier": "<BAY16-F6B1BA3EEE93418B841C14E4560@phx.gbl>", "dc:subject": "FROM:MR NABA MOHAMMED", "dc:title": "FROM:MR NABA MOHAMMED", "dcterms:created": "2006-08-06T05:00:09Z"}
