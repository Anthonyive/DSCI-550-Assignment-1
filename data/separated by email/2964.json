My husband was among the few white rich farmers\r\nmurdered in cold blood by the war veterans backed by the government. Before the\r\ndeath of my husband, he deposit the sum of US$20.5M (Twenty Million Five hundred\r\nthousand United State Dollars) with one of the Financial Institution, as if he\r\nknew the looming danger in ZIMBABWE. We were married for twelve years and God\r\nblessed us with two children.\r\n\r\nPresently this money is still with the Financial Institution. Recently, my\r\nDoctor told me that I might not last for the next Eight months due to an\r\ninflammation of my liver. This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive care,\r\nin a private clinic here in Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I am tired of living like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nI have decided to donate part of this fund to an individual, group or a charity\r\norganisation that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein\r\nwhile half of the money shall be kept for the betterment of my children. I want\r\nan individual, or Charity Organisation that will use this fund for orphanages,\r\nwidows, and helping land mine victims worldwide.\r\n\r\nI took this decision because my husband's relatives are Trouble Makers and I\r\ndon't want my husband's efforts to be used for trivialities I do not want a\r\nsituation where my husband's sweat will be used in material pursuits. This is\r\nwhy I am taking this decision.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact name of my lawyer,\r\ntelephone number and email address who will issue you a letter of authority\r\nthat will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure to contact me immediately to enable me direct you to my lawyer.\r\n\r\nAny delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this\r\nsame purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated\r\nherein.\r\n\r\nHope to receive your reply.\r\n\r\nRemain blessed.\r\n\r\nYours Sister,\r\nMrs Teressa Stevens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2926", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mrs.Teressa Stevens.\" <sealed@kaixo.com>", "Mrs.Teressa Stevens. <sealed@kaixo.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1", "dc:identifier": "<1155555510.44e060b627577@imp5-g19.free.fr>", "dc:subject": "Mrs Teressa Stevens.", "dc:title": "Mrs Teressa Stevens.", "dcterms:created": "2006-08-14T11:38:30Z"}
