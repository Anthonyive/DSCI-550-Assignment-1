Freetown. According to my father. This money was the income accrued from mining co-operation's over draft and minor sales. Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power ofthe Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels.

The untimely deaths caused my mothers heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital After we must have spent a lot of money on her. Now my 16-year-old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help.Without any relation, we are now like refugees and orphans.
