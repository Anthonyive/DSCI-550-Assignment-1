What is needed at this stage is to find a very reliable, confidential and responsible friend who would assist me in the claims of these bonds without it reverting to the state. In this case, i would initiate a systematic transfer of the said bonds into a Dedicated Account opened in your name or company name, \nwhichever you find most appropriate. I would therefore need your response in order to grant you access to the detailed facts and figures of the bond. I have been able to contact you based on information retrieved from the credit reference database attached to my institution. I will be most willing to go into partnership with you to see this project completed in earnest.\n\nI assure you that there would be no issues to your name or person. All you would be required to do is to contact the offshore office for the purpose of concluding this transaction. I hope you understand why I cannot disclose exclusive data to you at this stage. Do kindly respond to me via my email address below or my fax number.Upon this, I would be able to send you more details regarding this project.If I do not hear from you in the next few days, I would assume you are notinterested but if you are, do also provide a phone/fax numbers you \ncould be reached on.
