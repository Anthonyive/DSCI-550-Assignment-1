I shall ask my son Mohammade to come over \nto your country to liaise with you. If this proposal satisfies you. please \ndo not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in \ntotal trust and confidence.\n\nPlease kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal \ntelephone and fax numbers.
