There after I will visit your country with my family for\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\n\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of\nkin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account\nnumber,\nyour private telephone and fax number for easy and effective\ncommunication and location where in the money will be remitted .\n\nOn your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or\nby email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide\nmaterials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment\nformalities from the payment Agency. I willbe handling official\nprotocols here and expect you to undertake international\nresponsibilities as I am assuring you of a risk free transaction\nprovided you display maturity.\n\nTherefore, if you are willing and interested to render\nthe needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my\nemail address .\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.\n\nYours sincerely.\n\nMR.
