I am the manager of bill and\nexchange at the foreign remittance department of\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)I am writing to seek\nyour interest over a transaction.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of\n$15m US dollars (FIFTEEN MILLIONS US DOLLARS) . In an\naccount that belongs to one of our foreign customer\nwho died along with his entire family in November\n2001  in a plane crash. Since we got information about\nhis death, we have been expecting his next of kin to\ncome over and claim his money because we cannot\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of\nkin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our\nbanking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that\nall his supposed next of kin   or relation died\nalongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody\nbehind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and one\nother official in my department have decided to make\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to\nyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is\ncoming for it and we don\ufffdt want this money to go into\nthe Bank's treasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if\nsuch money remained unclaimed after five years, the\nmoney will be transferred into the Bank's treasury as\nunclaimed fund. The request of  foreigner as next of\nkin in this business is occasioned by the fact that\nthe customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot\nstand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nWe agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as\nforeign partner, in respect to the provision of a\nforeign account,  10 % will be set aside for expenses\nincurred during the business and 50 % would be for me\nand my colleague. There after I will visit your\ncountry for disbursement of the fund according to the\npercentages indicated in this proposal. Therefore to\nenable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as\nrelations or next of kin of the deceased indicating\nyour bank name, your bank account number, your private\ntelephone and fax number for easy and effective\ncommunication and location where in the money will be\nremitted.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by\nemail the text of the application. I will not fail to\nbring to your notice that this transaction  is hitch\nfree and that you should not entertain any atom of\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for\nthe transfer .\n\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you\nreceive this letter.\n\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\n\n\nYour\ufffds faithfully RAJI RAJI\nBill and Exchange Manager,\nAfrica Development Bank (A.D.B)\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nD\u00e9couvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! \nwww.windowslivemessenger.fr\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3111", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"raji raji\" <ria_26@hotmail.fr>", "raji raji <ria_26@hotmail.fr>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed", "dc:identifier": "<BAY15-F1554CE390E25EB991B91A29B1D0@phx.gbl>", "dc:subject": "TREAT AS URGENT ", "dc:title": "TREAT AS URGENT ", "dcterms:created": "2006-10-04T11:11:51Z"}
