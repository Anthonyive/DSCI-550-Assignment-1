I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication.\r\n\r\nThe subject in questions was a client with my bank and until his demise he maintained an investment in millions of dollars, which has since reached its maturity. The subject maintained a discrete relationship with us and never nominated a legatee to his investment. At the time of his demise he was yet to sign the mandate card and he remained in testate. It is ethical that his investment with us be confiscated by government and to be reverted to treasury but not quite, it would be diverted and embezzled by insincere executives.\r\n\r\nConsequently, what I propose is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased. Acting in this capacity really is simple, as I will explain in detail to you when I get your response.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wish to appeal to you not to be vindictive if my proposal does not appeal to you, just delete it and forget I ever contacted you with this proposal. Ordinarily I would not do this but all humans have needs and there are circumstances that you would get to understand better should we work together on this project.\r\n\r\nAwaiting your urgent reply through my alternative email xmei_2001@126.com <mailto:xmei_2001@126.com> for security reasons.\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,\r\nXiao Mei\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3114", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["xmei_2001@163.com", "xmei_2001@163.com"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<trTETPp3w9$58.61.73.244$.4525482e.bc4b7.7910.1368@yuma.onspeed.com>", "dc:subject": "I need your assistance please !!!", "dc:title": "I need your assistance please !!!", "dcterms:created": "2006-10-05T18:00:11Z"}
