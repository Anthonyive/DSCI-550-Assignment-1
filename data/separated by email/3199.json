I HAVE DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU ON A \nBUSINESS TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF US AT THE END \nOF THE TRANSACTION .\n\n\nDURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME \nACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED IN A \nPLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK \nWITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR \nRELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT.\n\n\nTHE SAID AMOUNT WAS U.S 18.4M (EIGHTEEN MILLION,FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED \nSTATES DOLLARS). AS IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW, I GOT YOUR IMPRESSIVE \nCONTACTS THROUGH INTERNET. MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIM \nOVER THIS FUND AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, AND TRANSFER \nTHIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE.  THE DIRECTIVES AND \nNEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR \nINTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST ME, AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS \nGREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.\n\n\nIN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS \nCOUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN \nACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF \nTRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL \nREQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN \nWITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN \nACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS \nREQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE \nCORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM \nTO YOUR OWN DESIGNATION BANK ACCOUNT.\n\n\nI WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.ON \nSMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 40% OF THE \nTOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF \nEXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE AND \nINTERNET BILLS, WHILE 50% WILL BE FOR ME.  PLEASE, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVICED TO \nKEEP \"TOP SECRET\" AS I AM STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE \nAFTER WE CONCLUDE THIS DEAL WITH YOU.\n\n\nI WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THIS BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM \nTHE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK ME TO COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR \nSUBSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED \nAND FURTHER INVESTMENT, EITHER IN YOUR COUNTRY OR ANY COUNTRY YOU ADVICE US \nTO INVEST IN. ALL OTHER NECESSARY VITAL NFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU WHEN \nI HEAR FROM YOU.\n\n\nIF THE TRANSACTION INTEREST YOU, GET BACK TO ME WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO \nCALL YOU SO WE COULD PROCEED.\n\n\nTHANKS.\n\nMR NOEL PANGA.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWindows Live Spaces : cr\u00e9ez votre Space \u00e0 votre image ! \nhttp://www.msn.fr/spaces/\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3158", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Noel PANGA\" <panga4@hotmail.fr>", "Noel PANGA <panga4@hotmail.fr>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed", "dc:identifier": "<BAY15-F107A3E785C903BD012FF35F70E0@phx.gbl>", "dc:subject": "Mr Noel PANGA.", "dc:title": "Mr Noel PANGA.", "dcterms:created": "2006-10-17T08:33:10Z"}
