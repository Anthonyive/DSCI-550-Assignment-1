It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. \n  \u00a0\n  But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.\n \n  \u00a0\n  I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:- \n  \u00a0\n  1. Can I completely trust you? \n  2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you? \n  \u00a0\n  Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.\n  \u00a0\n  Thank you so much. \n  \u00a0\n  My sincere regards, \n  \u00a0\n  MISS marie ahmed\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\n\n\n\nD\u00e9couvrez une nouvelle fa\u00e7on d'obtenir des r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 toutes vos questions ! \nDemandez \u00e0 ceux qui savent sur Yahoo!
