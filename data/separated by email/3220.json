I introduce myself as Mr. Andrew Gama staff in\nthe accounts management Section of a well-known bank in South Africa.\n\nOne of our accounts with holding balance of \u00a315,000,000\n(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and last operated in\nthe past 3 years. From my investigations and confirmations, the owner\nof this account is a Foreigner by name Gerald Stone died on the 4th of\nJanuary 2002 on a planecrash in Birmingham UK.\n\nSince then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money as he\nhas no family Member who is aware of the existence of either the\naccountn or the Funds.Information from the National Immigration also\nstates that he was single on entry into South Africa.\n\nI have confidentially discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and\nwe have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We\nthus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of\nthese funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due\nprocesses have been followed.\n\nThis transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is Legitimate and\ndoes not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other Illegal act. \n\nOn your interest, let me hear from you.\n\nRegards,\nMR ANDREW GAMA\na.gama0@yahoo.com.hk\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3179", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"MR.
