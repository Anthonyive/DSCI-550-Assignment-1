The business\u00a0 underdiscussion has to do with one of our customer a national of your\ncountry, who is a Consultant/ contractor with Societe Nationale Des\u00a0 Products D' Agricole (SONAPRA) Company in Benin-Cotonou. I managed to get your\u00a0 contact details through the Internet search\u00a0 myself because time is of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 importance to it and I am desperately looking for Someone to assist me to pull this money out from the bank before our\u00a0\u00a0 corrupt government\nofficials will confiscate the money.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, December 25, 2003, this our customer , his wife and their\u00a0 only daughter were involved in Air-Crash near the Atlantic Ocean in Cotonou\u00a0 suburb. For more clarifications, you can visit the CNN web news for the\u00a0 tragedy.\n\n\nwww.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash\n\n\n\nSince then I have made several inquiries to your Embassy, in a bid to locate any relation of this our customer. All attempts to reach the\u00a0 next of\u00a0 kin of our customer has been futile as He had no family here in Benin Republic.Hence my decision to contact you. I want you and I to go into\npartnership, the nature of your business is completely irrelevant to this transaction as all I need from you is an assurance that my\u00a0 interest will be fully protected once this transaction is concluded.\n\n\n\nHe made a numbered time (fixed) deposited for twelve calendar Months\u00a0 and his account with our Bank accrues to about (Fourteen Million, Three\u00a0 hundred and Fifty- Two Thousand US Dollars) $USD14.352M.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Benin Law, at the expiration of (Three) years, the\u00a0 money will revert to the ownership of the Benin government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to our customer so that the\nfruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt\u00a0 government officials who will latter use the money to sponsor war in Africa and\u00a0 kill innocent citizens in the search for political power/seat. Please note\u00a0 that There will be no problem at all, my position as the Director of\nOperation guarantees the successful execution of this\u00a0 transaction within 7 Banking days and the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 40% for you and 60% for me.\n\n\nThis is very simple, I will like you to reply immediately so that I can send you the Text of application which you will fill and apply to the bank as the next of kin to our customer and I will use my good position in the bank as the Director of Operation to make sure that the application is approved,\nduring board meeting for immediate payment. If you are\u00a0\u00a0 interested, reply \nimmediately via my private email address: peterdanielx4@hotmail.com\n\n\n\nSo that we can proceed at once. Please send to me also your private\u00a0 phone,\u00a0 or mobile numbers for easier correspondence.\n\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n\nBest Regards.\nPeter Daniel.\n\n\nPrivate email:\u00a0\u00a0 peterdanielx4@hotmail.com\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3249", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"peter daniel\" <peterdanielx6@pobox.sk> of your", "peter daniel <peterdanielx6@pobox.sk>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=windows-1250 Someone to assist me to pull this money out from the bank before our&n=", "dc:identifier": "<4b183712853c4557b958d8f4f4f7845d@pobox.sk> only daughter were involved in Air-Crash near the Atlantic Ocean in Co=", "dc:subject": "YOUR ASSISTANCE NEEDED.
