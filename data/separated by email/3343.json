This mail might come to you as a \nsurprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could \ncome into \nyour mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a \ndeep sense of humility. \n\nI am Mr.Anuka Ifufeh, the Auditor General of \nNED BANK PLC here South Africa, during the \ncourse of our auditing, I \ndiscovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank 1995 and \nsince 1998 nobody has operated on this account again.After going \nthrough some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of \nthe account died without a [heir] hence \nthe money is floating and if I \ndo not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.\n\nThe owner of this account is Mr. Franklin Sullivan, a foreigner, a \nminer and an industrialist.He made millions of dollars before he died \nmisteriously .Since 1998 no other person knows about this account or \nany thing concerning it. My investigation proved to me that the account \nhas no other beneficiary and that Mr. Franklin Sullivan until his death \nwas the manager Sullivan Coy.\n(pty). SA. We will start the first \ntransfer with Thirty six million dollars [$36,000,000.00] upon \nsuccessful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall \nre-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.\n\nThe \namount involved is (USD $136M) Thirty Six Million United States Dollars \nonly. I want to first transfer $36,000.000 [Thirty Six Million United \nStates Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad \nbefore the rest, but I don't know any foreigner.\n\nI am revealing this \nto you with believing God that you will never let me down in this \nbusiness. Also send your private telephone number and fax number \nincluding the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I \nneed your strong assurance that you will never let me down in this \nbusiness proposition. With my influence and the position of a bank \nofficial whom is working in our favour we can transfer this money to \nany foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance \nthat this money will be intact pending our physical arrival \nin your \ncountry for sharing. \n\nThe bank official will destroy all documents of \ntransaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any \nplace and to build confidence you can come immediately to discuss with \nme face to face after which I will make this remittance in your \npresence and three of us will fly to your country@least two days ahead \nof the money going into the account. \n\nAt the conclusion of this \nbusiness, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be \nfor \nme, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred \nduring the process of transferring.\n\nBest Regards,\nMr.Anuka Ifufeh.\n\nNB: YOU SHOULD SEND ME YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER IN YOUR REPLY FOR \nEASY \nCOMMUNICATION.\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3296", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Mr.Anuka Ifufeh.", "Mr. Anuka Alex Ifufeh. <alex_dickson15@virgilio.it>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=\"UTF-8\"", "dc:subject": "VERY IMPORTANT.", "dc:title": "VERY IMPORTANT.", "dcterms:created": "2006-11-24T17:37:39Z"}
