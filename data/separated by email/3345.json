The Vittorio Foundation has been assured of highest\norganization standard courtesy of the United Nations. It is our belief\nthat we can achieve a great positive change in the general welfare of the\nuniverse through this program. That is why the foundation is doing\neverything possible to get all recipients notified of their donation.\n\nNote that your country is not the only country that is benefiting from\nthis donation. Beneficiaries have been chosen from countries from all\ncontinents. The idea of this donation is that within ten years from now,\nthere will be notable richness among many unusual people around the world.\nThis will give many people the opportunity to get their lives to a stage\nwhere they had always wanted.\n\nKindly note that you will only be chosen to receive the donation once,\nwhich means that subsequent yearly donation will not get to you again.\nTake time and thought in spending the donation wisely on something that\nwill last you a long time. Recipients are only eligible to be awarded this\ndonation once.\n\nBased on the random selection exercise of internet websites and millions\nof supermarket cash invoices worldwide, you were selected among the lucky\nrecipients to receive the award sum of $2,500,000.00 (Two Million Five\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars) as charity donations/aid from the\nVittorio Foundation, ECOWAS, EU and the UNO in accordance with the\nenabling act of Parliament.

This\nmeans that your qualification number will be reffled to know the\norganisation (ECOWAS or EU) that will handle your payment. You are to keep\nthis whole information confidential until you have been able to collect\nyour donation, as there have been many cases of double and unqualified\nclaim, due to beneficiaries informing third parties about his/her donation.\n\nFinally, all funds should be claimed by their respective beneficiaries, no\nlater than 15 days after notification. Failure to do so will mean\ncancellation of that beneficiary and its donation will then be reserved\nfor next year?s recipients.
