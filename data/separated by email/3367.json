I am a\n survival because I visited Jakarta the period of these incidents.\n\n     When my father was alive, he revealed to me about the fund deposit which\n he had in a financial institute here in Malaysia. Presently, I am here\n in Malaysia under the UNHCR, but with the intention to notify the\n financial institute about my inheritance. I reside in the refugee camp\n here. Therefore I will want you to assist retrieve my inheritance for\n any good investment in your country. But you must assure me of your\n trust worthiness and sincerer before we continue, as this inheritance\n fund is I'm banking all my future hope. I thought it will be dangerous\n to-invest this fund in my country Indonesia, due to economic and\n political instability facing my country as at the moment. So want to\n invest it abroad. For your foreign assistance, i have agreed to offer\n you 20% of the total amount of the money. I have all the vital documents\n covering the deposit, which I can send to you on request. NOTE: I have\n never disclosed this to any person apart from you. Please you have to\n keep this very confidential. We shall talk more as soon as I hear from\n you.
