BUT UPON THE ARRIVAL OF THE CONSIGNMENT  \r\nIN INDIA, HE WAS TOLD TO PAY THE SUM OF US$600 TO CLEAR THE  \r\nSONSIGNMENT AT THE AIRPORT AND HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY IT. HE TOLD  \r\nME TO SEND THE MONEY TO HIM THROUGH THE WESTER UNION MONEY TRANSFER TO  \r\nENABLE HIM CLEAR THE CONSIGNMENT, BUT I COULD NOT SEND HIM THE MONEY  \r\nAS WESTERN UNION MONEY TRANSFER DOES NOT SEND OUT MONEY IN THIS  \r\nCOUNTRY.
