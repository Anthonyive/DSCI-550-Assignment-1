Early last year there\r\nwas a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of\r\nNigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities\r\nhomeless.The contract was handled by a foreign firm but\r\nbecause of the huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided\r\nto over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been\r\ncompleted and the original contractor has since been\r\npaid,but the contract balance of US$38 million,which\r\nresulted from the over invoiced contract sum that has been\r\nleft in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION\r\nCOMMITTEE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE APEX BANK,is what me and my\r\npartners are planning to take out of the country for\r\nourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not\r\nsuppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having\r\nforeign ones.To this end, we are soliciting your assistance\r\nas a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this\r\namount into your account. We are ready to share this money\r\nwith you on the basis of participation. We also have plans\r\nto invest part of this money in any viable business in your\r\ncountry under your care,as we are nearing our retirement\r\nage. In any case, I received a reference of\r\nyou/organization from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and\r\nIndustry \u2018Foreign Trade Division\u2019 as a reputable organ that\r\ncan assist us on this transaction. Please if you accept my\r\nproposal do not hesitate to send me a fax on 234 1 759 0379\r\nor send me an e-mail on:\r\nadamuohiroma, so that I can provide you with the basic\r\nprocedures for the release of the fund. It does not matter\r\nwhether you or your company does contract project of the\r\nnature described here, the assumption is that you won a\r\nmajor contract and subcontracted it to another company,\r\nmore often than not, big trading companies or individuals\r\nof unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and\r\nsubcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution.\r\nBENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit this\r\nmoney, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70%\r\nwill be for me and my partners,while 5% has been set aside\r\nto cover any expenses that may be incurred by both parties\r\nduring this transaction, both local and international.\r\nPlease I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost\r\ndegree of maturity and confidentiality because I am still\r\nin active government service with the \u201cNIGERIAN NATIONAL\r\nPETROLEUM CORPORATION\u201d. If I receive your response on time,\r\nthis whole transaction could be accomplished within the\r\nshortest possible time based on your interest and\r\ndetermination,since the money is already in transit.\r\nPlease, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of your\r\nfax or e-mail.The lines may be busy,but keep trying till\r\nyou get through.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nDR, ADAMS OBOZUWA.
