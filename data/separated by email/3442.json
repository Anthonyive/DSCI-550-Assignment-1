I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i \ndecided to contact you through this medium.\n\nAs you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Razaq Samiu, a merchant in Dubai, in the \nU.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has \ndefiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. \n\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know \nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this \nworld I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties \nand assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, \nEngland and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash that I deposit in a bank in England Uk.\n\nI want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Razaq Samiu that is making this generous donation. \n\nI am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed in England where I wait for my time to come. If you are interested to help me i will give you more information about this like the amount that i deposited in the bank and Contact of the bank so you can contcat them. I will also send you a picture of my self when i am on my laptop in the hospital. \n\nNote that you will take 20% out of the funds and give 80% to the charity organizations. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart God be with you. \n\nIf you can help respond back to me on my private email: razaqin01@yahoo.es\n\nRazaq Samiu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3395", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Razaq Samiu <yvette.oldenburger@home.nl>", "Razaq Samiu <yvette.oldenburger@home.nl>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=utf-8", "dc:identifier": "<6385676.1167240952233.JavaMail.root@webmail1.groni1>", "dc:subject": "Email from Samiu", "dc:title": "Email from Samiu", "dcterms:created": "2006-12-27T17:35:46Z"}
