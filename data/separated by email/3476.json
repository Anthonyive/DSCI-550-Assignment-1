This \nfund arose from the overinvoicing of various contracts awarded in my \nparastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago. We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, were mandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts.\n\nWe all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank \naccount provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in united State of America,but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement\nwill take effect.\n\nWe are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of of the amount for your assistance and services.\n\nThis transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitive positions\nwe cannot afford a slip.\nI assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with\nour identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully\nestablished and smooth operation commences. I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so, \ncontact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure. Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very great importanceb for security reasons.\nPlease treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency.\nN.B: Your telephone and fax numbers are needed for easy communication.\nBest regards,\nDR.Daniel Ibe.\nCIVIL SERVANT\nFEDERAL MINISTRY OF\nPETROLEUM AND MINERAL\nRESOURCES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3429", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"DR.DANIEL IBE.\" <danielibe1616@yahoo.com.au>", "DR.DANIEL IBE. <danielibe1616@yahoo.com.au>"], "dc:format": "text/plain", "dc:identifier": "<E1H4cfI-0006OY-Ju@orion.interservers.com>", "dc:subject": "URGENT ASSISTANCE", "dc:title": "URGENT ASSISTANCE", "dcterms:created": "2007-01-10T12:34:48Z"}
