Luckily to us, my\nsecond son has escaped to South Africa through the border where he\nreside as a political refugee.\nSo my reason of contacting you is because of the problem which my son\nis facing in trying to transfer the money, the labour law of South Africa\ndoes not permit an asylum seeker (Refugee) the right to financial\ntransaction.\nThis was the basic reason why I decide to contact you, so that you will\nstand as the beneficiary of the fund. If we agree on this, then the\nownership of the consignment/funds and every documents will\nautomatically be changed to your name.\nWe are offering you 30% of the total money, as a commission for your\nservices, while 70% goes to my family, which we intend to invest\nimmediately we are being released from house arrest.\nI am assuring you that this transaction is risk free, all we need from\nyou is your co-operation and sincerity of purpose.\nYou will be contacting my son Peter Savimbi on Email:\npetersavimbi7@webmail.co.za  for more  details on how to conclude this\ntransaction.\nI will wait for your response through my son, thank you and God bless.\nIn your email to my son Peter, kindly forward to him the following as\nit will be used during the process of change of ownership:\n1 You're Full Name\n2.You're Contact (Home) Address\n3.Your Telephone Moble/Home,and Fax number\n4.You can also call my son on his phone number in South Africa +27\n724340319.\nThanks and may the almighty father guide us through.\nThank you.\nMrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi\nFor: Savimbi Family.\nALTERNATIVE EMAIL: petersavimbi5@webmail.co.za\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3451", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Mrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi", "MRS.
