I have urgent and very confidential business\nproposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time\n(Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at\nUS$40,000,000.00,\n(forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.\n\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address\nbut got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we\ndiscovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his\nholidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out\nthat he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin\nwas fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.\nBarry\nKelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,\nincluding his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of\nUS$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for\nSafekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British\nLaw, at\nthe expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of\nthe British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\n\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the\nowner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes\nthough  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I\ntagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because\nI as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign\naccount or have an account that is more than $1m.\nI want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company\nso you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is\nsimple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so\nthat the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in\nplace as the as the owner of the boxes.\n\nThe money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me\nand 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this\ntransaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the\nsuccessful execution of this transaction.\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address\nupon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant\ndocuments that will help you understand the transaction.\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like\nhouses, hotels and doing charity works etc)\nPlease do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we\ncan have a smooth communication.\nAwaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )\n\nThanks and regards.\n\nTONY SMITH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3492", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["tonysmith@freeola.net", "tonysmith@freeola.net"], "dc:format": "text/plain;", "dc:identifier": "<20070206231151.z8uc8mnjmsggcokw@pop.freeola.net>", "dc:subject": "letter from smith", "dc:title": "letter from smith", "dcterms:created": "2007-02-06T23:11:51Z"}
