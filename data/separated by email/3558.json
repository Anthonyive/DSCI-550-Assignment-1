I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail co=\nnfidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a =\nresult of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation a=\nnd no one is informed of this communication. =0D\n=0D\nThe subject in questions was a client with my bank and until his demise h=\ne maintained an investment in millions of dollars, which has since reache=\nd its maturity. The subject maintained a discrete relationship with us an=\nd never nominated a legatee to his investment. At the time of his demise =\nhe was yet to sign the mandate card and he remained in testate. It is eth=\nical that his investment with us be confiscated by government and to be r=\neverted to treasury but not quite, it would be diverted and embezzled by =\ninsincere executives. =0D\n=0D\nConsequently, what I propose is that I will like you as a foreigner to st=\nand in as the next of kin to the deceased. Acting in this capacity really=\n is simple, as I will explain in detail to you when I get your response. =\n=0D\n=0D\nHowever, I wish to appeal to you not to be vindictive if my proposal does=\n not appeal to you, just delete it and forget I ever contacted you with t=\nhis proposal. Ordinarily I would not do this but all humans have needs an=\nd there are circumstances that you would get to understand better should =\nwe work together on this project. =0D\n=0D\nAwaiting your urgent reply through my alternative email xmei_2001@163.com=\n for security reasons.=0D\n=0D\nYours Sincerely,=0D\nMrs.Xian=0D\n=0D\n=0D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3510", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Xiao mei <xmei_2001@mail15.com>", "Xiao mei <xmei_2001@mail15.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain", "dc:identifier": "<20070218184236.65A1E125BD15@web-streaming.net>", "dc:subject": "I need your urgent assistance please", "dc:title": "I need your urgent assistance please", "dcterms:created": "2007-02-18T17:33:19Z"}
