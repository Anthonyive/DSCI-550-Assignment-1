In an account that belongs to one of our foreign \ncustomer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane \ncrash.\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash \nleaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \ndepartment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release \nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety \nand subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\ufffdt want \nthis money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of \nthis money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision \nof a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the \nbusiness and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues.\n\nThen after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted . \nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \nthe application.\n\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free \nand that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required \narrangements have been made for the transfer . you should contact me \nimmediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you \nimmediately.  PLEASE MY DEAR  FRIEND THIS IS MY PRIVATE LINE YOU CAN  CALL   \nME IMMIDEATELY YOU RECEIVE THIS MAIL.  00226 (76  63  87 21)\n\nTHANKS\nMR JAVED AHMED.\nB.O.A (BANK OF AFRICA)\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Hotmail : cr\u00e9ez votre adresse e-mail gratuite & \u00e0 vie ! \nhttp://www.msn.fr/newhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3513", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"javed ahmed\" <javed_ahmed1952@hotmail.com>", "javed ahmed <javed_ahmed1952@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed", "dc:identifier": "<BAY136-F30DA74AC3603E5A84B5935868F0@phx.gbl>", "dc:subject": " TREAT  AS URGENT AND CALL ME\"\"\"\" 00226 76 63 87 21", "dc:title": " TREAT  AS URGENT AND CALL ME\"\"\"\" 00226 76 63 87 21", "dcterms:created": "2007-02-22T13:07:51Z"}
