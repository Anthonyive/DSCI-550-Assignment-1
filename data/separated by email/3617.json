My names are Angela Mary CHATHAM and I will 44yrs old on Sunday March 18th 2007. I worked with SNS Bank of Netherlands for Fourteen years and resigned as a Credit Manager and now am back to the United Kingdom due to my failing health condition. I have been married once but now am divorced and no children though would have loved to have children. I am confined to this place due to my deteriorating health condition and have opted for this medium of communication as it is my only available means to reach out to people of like minds.\n \nPlease take this correspondence very seriously and act promptly as this may be the beginning of innovative ideas for you. I have a very confidential issue to share w ith you if only you can treat it as such keep it secret.\n \nPlease contact me immediately if you can keep secrets and are eager to know this confidential issue which shall be of mutual benefit if pursued to its conclusion.\n\nI am anxiously waiting for your prompt response as I pray this will be the beginning of a lasting and mutually rewarding union between us.\n \nThanking you for your time and attention in anticipation of your prompt response.\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\nMary A. CHATHAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3569", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mary A.
