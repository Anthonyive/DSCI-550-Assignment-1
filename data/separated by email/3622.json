Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful.\n\n\nAfter these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to contact a foreigner who will act as the next of kin to the deceased instead of the money going into the federal government coffers. I have contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confisicated or declared\u00a0 unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged.Particularly,the Eco Bank Plc where the deceased had an account valued at about 15 million united states dollars has issued a notice for the next of kin to surface or have the account confisicated\u00a0 within the next ten official working days.\n\n\nsince i have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 3 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased hence we claim this fund for our own benefits so that the proceeds of this account valued at 15 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. \n\n\nI have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement\u00a0 that will protect you from any breach of the law.furnish me with the below information to enable the bank transfer the fund to your bank account.\n\n\n(1) Your phone and fax number for easy coversation\n(2) Your occupation and your age.\n\n\nOnce I hear from you I will tell you the next line of action.Please\u00a0 reply if you are interested through only in my alternative email address: (mark_ibe1@yahoo.com)\n\n\nBest Regards,\nDr.Mark Ibe.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEncuentra las noticias mas actualizadas de El Salvador y el mundo en www.elsalvador.com", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3574", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"mark_ibe02@elsalvador.com\" <mark_ibe02@elsalvador.com> now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the decease=", "mark_ibe02@elsalvador.com <mark_ibe02@elsalvador.com>"], "dc:format": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "dc:identifier": "<12f2e2cc5afc4ab68e3894811b9c459b.mark_ibe02@elsalvador.com> deposits were lodged.Particularly,the Eco Bank Plc where the deceased ha=", "dc:subject": "AWAITING YOUR RESPONSE", "dc:title": "AWAITING YOUR RESPONSE", "dcterms:created": "2007-03-18T04:21:08Z"}
