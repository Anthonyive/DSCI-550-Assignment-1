As a result of over invoicing masterminded by \nthe concerned officials, has been drafted to represent final payment for a \ncontract that has been executed to the Committee last years back. The money is \nnow floating in the suspense account of Federal Reserve Bank of South Africa \nawaiting claim by Foreign Partner which status we now want you to assume.\n\n\nNow is the optimum period to consummate this\ntransaction. Following the \npresidential directive to all parastatals to settle all outstanding debts owed \nto both local and foreign contractors. \nIn my last meeting with the officials \ninvolved, it was unanimously agreed that 35% of the total sum will be given to \nyou. 60% will be for my colleague, and me.While 5% will he used to reimburse the \nexpenses that may be incurred in the processing of the transfer.\n\n\nI assure you the transaction is 100% risk free as we have concluded every \narrangement to protect the interest of every one involved. Likewise, all \nmodalities for the successful transfer of this money \nhave been worked out \nwith the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Reserve Bank of South \nAfrica to facilitate the remittance of this money to your \ndesignated \naccount.\n\n\nHowever. I would want to believe that you are honest enough and will not \nraise any misgiving attitude in any aspect of the transaction, more importantly, \nyou will keep this transaction very confidential \nso as not to tarnish the \nconfidence reposed on these officials by the Government of South Africa.\n\n\nlf this business proposal is of interest to you, then kindly contact me via \ntelephone or email.\n\n\nMeanwhile, your immediate response will be highly appreciated. Please treat \nthis information as confidential.\n\n\n\nBest regards, \n\n\nMr.Roland Bartic\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3579", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Roland Bartic\" <roland-bartic@teenmail.co.za> charset=\"utf-8\"", "Roland Bartic <roland-bartic@teenmail.co.za>"], "dc:format": "text/html;", "dc:identifier": "<20070318225947.D237AC04C@krusty.si.UM>", "dc:subject": "URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION", "dc:title": "URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION", "dcterms:created": "2007-03-18T23:32:58Z"}
