Most belonged to Holocaust victims.\n\nThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP)have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts -54 ,000 in December, 1999.\n\n\n\nThe published lists contain all types of dormant\n\naccounts,including interest-bearing savings accounts,\n\nsecurities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.\n\nNumbered accounts are also included.Interest is\n\npaid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.\n\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens.\n\nA dormant account of Hami Ramzy with a credit balance of 15,800,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me.\n\n\n\nThe beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of theirs.\n\n\n\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of\n\nSwitzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased benefi ciaries who died interstate living no wills).\n\nBeing a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. \n\nThe funds will be banked in the Holland, London or Spain, being a safe for funds and we\n\ncan share the funds and use in investment of our choice.\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, \n\nI need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds.\n\n\n\nAll that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you.\n\nKindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. \n\nFor the fund to be transferred to a secure, numbered account in your name and country via any of the corresponding banks in London or Spain, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. \n\nMy share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 pe r cent of the total amount.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED, The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting\n\nsubmission of valid claims for necessary disbursement, I find myself privileged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for your prompt response.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nDr Kenneth cole.\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________\n\nThe Student Zone http://www.thestudentzone.com\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3672", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["kennethcoleszmailcom@thestudentzonemail.com", "kennethcoleszmailcom@thestudentzonemail.com"], "dc:format": "text/html;", "dc:identifier": "<200704241304.l3OD3ee1000628@tuxbox1.maxetek.com>", "dc:subject": "From Dr Kenneth", "dc:title": "From Dr Kenneth", "dcterms:created": "2007-04-24T13:03:40Z"}
