It is completely risk free. The money inquestion I want to\u00a0 transfer\u00a0 into your bank account is my inheritance from my late father. \nIt\u00a0 is a\u00a0 legally acquired money so there is nothing wrong about it.\u00a0 Because,Before\u00a0 the death of my father in the united kingdom, He sincerely\u00a0 called me on\u00a0 his bed side\u00a0 and\u00a0 told me that he had a sum of Eight million\u00a0 Three \nhundred\u00a0\u00a0 thousand United state Dollars ($8,300,000 US DOLLARS)\u00a0 kept in\u00a0 a local bank here in the united kingdom.He also used his name\u00a0 to\u00a0 Deposit the\u00a0 money,and me\u00a0 as his only daughter as next of kin/heir.i am the only \nsurvival of the\u00a0 family as my mum died 3 years\n before my dad of child\u00a0 birth. \nLike I told you in my mail, I am alone now. I want to transfer the\u00a0 money\u00a0 into your bank account after which, I shall travel to meet with\u00a0 you\u00a0 in\u00a0 your\u00a0 country so that we can invest the money in lucrative\u00a0 businesses. I \nam\u00a0 only\u00a0 21 years now and I do not have any experience of investment.\u00a0 I am\u00a0 hoping on\u00a0 you to make the investment. Last week, I went to the bank\u00a0 here\u00a0 where\u00a0 the\u00a0 money was deposited to inform them that I want them to\u00a0 release \nthe\u00a0 money to\u00a0 me. The bank people told me that their was an agreement\u00a0 with\u00a0 my late\u00a0 father during the time of deposit that the money will not be\u00a0 given or release\u00a0 to me\u00a0 until I am at least 24 years of age. Now that I am \nnot up\u00a0 to 24 years,\u00a0 the\u00a0 bank said that I have to appoint another person who\u00a0 will\u00a0 act as my\n \nguardian\u00a0 so that they will release and transfer the money directly to\u00a0 the\u00a0 person. The\u00a0 bank said that the person that I will appoint must be a\u00a0 least\u00a0 24 years\u00a0 or\u00a0 above. This is the reason why I have contacted you\u00a0 urgently to \nhelp me\u00a0 receive the money. The second reason is that my father who was\u00a0 poisoned\u00a0 by\u00a0 his own family before his death told me to transfer the\u00a0 money\u00a0 to a bank\u00a0 account of a person of my choice abroad and leave this\u00a0 country \nimmediately\u00a0 and also the crises here is getting worse and never\u00a0 subsides. I\u00a0 do not\u00a0 know\u00a0\u00a0 any one that I can contact this is reason why I have\u00a0 requested you to\u00a0 help\u00a0 me. \nMy dear It is true that we do not know each other before now, I believe\u00a0 that\u00a0 we can work with one another and become a very reliable partners.\u00a0 I\u00a0\u00a0 know for\u00a0 sure that both of\n us will handle this transaction to a mutual \nbenefit.\u00a0\u00a0 once\u00a0 I hear and concluded with you, I shall give you the\u00a0 contact\u00a0 of the bank\u00a0 here\u00a0 so that you can contact the bank as my guardian and\u00a0 request for urgent\u00a0 transfer of this fund to your account.\u00a0\u00a0 The bank is already aware that I should appoint some one and they have \nbeen\u00a0 waiting for me to give them the name of the person. The bank will\u00a0 work\u00a0 directly with you and will release the money directly to you. Once the\u00a0 money\u00a0 is released, the bank will transfer the money into any account \nthat\u00a0 you\u00a0 will\u00a0 donate. \nThis means that you will need to provide a bank account where the money\u00a0 will\u00a0 be transferred into. it does not matter if there is money in the\u00a0 account or\u00a0 not. All the bank needs is a valid account that can receive\u00a0 the\u00a0 money\u00a0 when\u00a0 it is transferred. Once the\n money is transferred into the\u00a0 account that\u00a0 you\u00a0 shall donate, you shall send me some money back here\u00a0 so\u00a0 that I can\u00a0 arrange\u00a0 for my traveling documents .
