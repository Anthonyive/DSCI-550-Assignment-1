I am writing this letter to you to intimate you  of a pending transaction I want to execute with you privately. Anyway I got your  contact through one of the Internet Reference Directories in my Chambers. One of my valued clients - Mr. Antonio Montoya died together with his lovely  wife Late Antonio Montoya died on the Flight 11, a Boeing 767-200, which was  enroute to Los Angeles from Boston during the terrorist attack on America back  in 2001. \r\n\r\nI was his personal lawyer and the Executor of his Will. There is no  further traces of any of his next-of-kin in his native Country. As his personal lawyer and Executor of his Will, I know late Antonio Montoya  kept about GBP 9.2 million in the Vaults of a bank here in London.  This money  had been taken to the bank late on the evening of his departure to USA, hence  the money was only accepted  and registered by the bank while it was kept in the  Vault waiting for Montoya's return, which was never to be.\r\n\r\n I have sinceconfirmed  with the bank that the money is still in the bank's vault. Ever since 2001 this  money has been in this account untouched!    Now,how do you come in and what is your business with all this?\r\nI am sure this  is the question you would be asking me? \r\n\r\nSimple, As the personal lawyer to late  Antonio Montoya and since vital document relating to this money is kept with my  Chambers, I decided that I intimate you of this development, with your  co-operation, I can present you to bank as the Next-of-Kin to the late Antonio  Montoya. \r\nAfter proper verification of this Claim by the bank this money will be  transferred to your bank account hence you come in as the Next-of-Kin to late  Antonio Montoya. How do we do it?  The document showing that this money is kept in the bank's  vault is kept in my Law Chambers. \r\n\r\nI, as the lawyer and Executor of late Antonio  Montoya's Will/Last Testament will put your name in this Will as the Beneficiary  of this money kept in the bank's vault. \r\nI will submit the Will/Last Testament to  the Bank to contact you and start processing transfer of this money to your bank  account according to the last wishes of my Client - late Mr. Montoya for further  administration to other members of the family.\r\n\r\n I am the Executor of late  Montoya's Will. All I need to do is to re-make the late Mr. Montoya's Will/Last Testament to  include your name as the beneficiary and submit same to the bank and introduce  you, the bank writes you to confirm this, then transfer process starts without  delays.\r\n\r\nI am the Executor of this Will and the Bank knows it too.The mode of  sharing this money will be discussed when we agree to work together on this  transaction. What do you think about this?  While I look forward to hearing from you soon,absolute confidentiality and secrecy remain very important in this transaction. \r\n\r\nThank you and God bless you.    \r\n\r\nBarrister Gareth Jones. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3756", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Barrister Gareth Jones\" <helen@ab-sa.co.za> =0D=0A=0D=0AI, as the lawyer and Executor of late Antonio  Montoya's Will/=", "Barrister Gareth Jones <helen@ab-sa.co.za>"], "dc:identifier": "<be3f90507ac14a05ba63e2e863dc1daf@ab-sa.co.za> sharing this money will be discussed when we agree to work together on thi=", "dc:subject": "From: Barrister Gareth Jones Tel:+44 703 184 4817", "dc:title": "From: Barrister Gareth Jones Tel:+44 703 184 4817", "dcterms:created": "2007-06-12T14:21:57Z"}
