In fact the total\r\nsum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of\r\nUS$700.Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make\r\nme poor for life. You may be surprise how I got to know but\r\nI will tell you when you reply. I repose great confidence\r\nin you hence my approach to you. due to security network\r\nplaced on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit\r\nthe embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I\r\nhope you will not betray my confidence in you.
