I summoned the courage to engage you in a business relationship that will be of achievement to both of us. As a matter of urgency and great value my main reason of contacting you today is based on a business transaction that one of my clients who is a senior bank director disclosed to me. In order to transfer the sum of (US$17.5M) seventeen million five hundred thousand united state dollars which was deposited in their bank by some top government officials \r\ninto any reliable foreign bank account. I was mandated to search for an honest partner abroad who can work jointly with us to achieve this great opportunity.\r\n\r\n Those funds was deposited in there bank in 2002 by some African top politicians who used their position in their offices to embezzle government treasury some of those politicians ran away from their country as soon as new government took over power to avoid probing them for their misappropriation and embezzlement of government funds. The new government in power has ordered for the confiscation of their properties including their bank accounts for their evil operation. From my discussions with the senior director before contacting you he told me that financial authority will be visiting their bank by next month for investigation however I was convinced that the deal must be successful and risk free as the funds will be transferred secretly to your account without hitch I promise not to relate this deal to any other person till I hear from you. Beer in mind that none of us will like to be involved in any kind of business that will stain or jeopardize his position in the offic\r\ne as we all have names to protect in the society. note that all mechanism has been mapped out for the actualization of this project. \r\n\r\nThis project will be concluded within 7_14 bank working days from the day we start the process. I will give you more details and the next step as soon as I confirm your ability and interest to participant in this project. My assurance to you is that this project will not effect or harm you as we will provide all the necessary documents that will cover the transfer to your account.
