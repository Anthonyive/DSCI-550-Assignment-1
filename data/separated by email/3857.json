I choose to reach you through this medium because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and \nprivate, and it should be treated as such.\n\nAt first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. My name is Mr.Kenneth Mashaba , the chief Financial officer of one of the commercial bank in Johannesburg South Africa. \n\nThere is an account that has not been operational for the past Fifteen years as the owner died leaving nobody as the next of kin. My bank shall confiscate the amount in the account US$12Million (Twelve Million United States Dollars) by the end of next month if we are not able to track anyone that knows the beneficiary.\n\nI want to present you as the next of kin to the former holder of the \naccount to enable our bank legitimately transfer the sum to your overseas \naccount. \n\nIf you are interested please get back to me together with your personal details through my private email above and I will furnish you with the details that you need to know and the procedure about this transaction.Please get back to me immediately on this so that we act fast and get the money transferred into your overseas account without any delay.\n\nFinaly, if you know that you are not willing and capable to handle this transaction please do not reply, but if you know that you are willing and capable to handle this transaction go ahead and send me your personal information to enable us proceed.\n\nI await your urgent Response.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMr.Kenneth Mashaba\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3808", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:format": "text/html;", "dc:identifier": "<15cbef75ec8749b7ad368a9a14778d20@ab-sa.co.za> together with your personal details through my private email above and I w=", "dcterms:created": "2007-07-02T15:38:31Z"}
