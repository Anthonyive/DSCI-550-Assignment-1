It was in one of this attacks by the rebels that led to the death of my husband and three of my children , now I am left with only my last son David . \n\n\u00a0\n\nI was terrified of the situation and because of this I escaped with my son David from Sierra - Leone to cote d' Ivoire into a refugee camp but brought along the sum of u.s$12.5 million , in a metallic box and presently in a security company as family valuables . \n\n\u00a0\n\nMy aim of contacting you is to seek for your able assistance as a front in transferring this fund abroad into an\u00a0 account , then as a business developer , you can help us to invest wisely in areas you deem lucrative and finally obtain a residential permit for us to stay comfortable in your country of abode . \n\n\u00a0\n\nPresently we cannot go back to Sierra- Leone because of the situation there and you know that cote d' Ivoire where we are now is politically unstable; we therefore wish you could help us get out of here before it become worse. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are prepared to offer you 10% of the total funds for your able assistance and support and would send you proofs of the funds as soon as we favourably hear from you . \n\n\u00a0\n\nFinally I implore you to treat this transaction with secrecy and confidentiality for security reasons . \n\n\u00a0\n\nThanking you in anticipation and God bless. \n\n\nMrs Theresa Coleman.\n\n\nD\u00e9couvrez Windows Live Spaces et cr\u00e9ez votre site Web perso en quelques clics !
