PLEASE NOTE THAT THE\r\nTRANSFER OPERATION WILL TAKE SEVEN TO TEN WORKING DAYS\r\nTO BE COMPLETED. I would need your personal assurance\r\nthat you would not sit on the money when its finally\r\nget into your account.\r\n\r\nSHARING MODALITIES:\r\nYou shall be entitled to 25% of this fund for your\r\nenvisaged efforts and assistance rendered. 5% has been\r\nset aside for reimbursement to both parties for\r\nincidental expenses that may be incurred in the course\r\nof this transaction. The remaining 70% would be for\r\nour company and the top officials.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is strictly confidential, free from any\r\nform of risk and does not depend on any particular\r\nfield of trade to prosecute.
