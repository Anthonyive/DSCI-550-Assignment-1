After these several unsuccessful attempts,\nI decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member\nof his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repartrating\nthe fund valued at US$13 million left behind by my client before it gets\nConfisicated or declaredunserviceable by the Security Finance Firm where\nthis huge amount weredeposited. The said Security Finance company has issued\nme a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated\nwithin the next fourteen official working days. For the fact that I have\nbeen unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek\nthe consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased,since you\nhave the same last name with my client, so that the proceeds of this account\ncan be paid to you. Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we\nshall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer.\n\nI have all necessary information and legal documents needed to back you\nup for claim.
