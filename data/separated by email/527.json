I was the account officer to one Mr. Ali B. Ashraf who died along\r\n with his family on the 8th of November 1998 in an ADC Boeing 747 plane\r\ncrash at Egirin River. All 141 passengers on board were feared dead.He\r\nleft\r\nin his domiciliary account the total sum of $15.5million Fifteen million\r\n five hundred thousand USA Dollars. Since the management got the\r\ninformation of his death we have been expecting any of his relation or\r\nhis next of kin to come up and claim his money. Unfortunately\r\nfrom the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his\r\nrelation or friends has come up for the claim. The banking and financial\r\n law of Union\r\nbank of Nigeria Plc stipulates that if such fund remained unclaimed\r\nafter a period of four (4) it will be transferred into the bank treasury\r\n as unclaimed bill.On this discovery sir, I and two other senior staffs\r\nnow\r\ndecided do business with you and release the money to you as the next of\r\n kin to Ali B. Ashraf for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will\r\nsoon proceed\r\nfor my retirement leave this year, and I personally do not want this\r\nfund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is\r\n why I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\nThe need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by\r\n the fact that the customer Mr. Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a\r\nNigerian cannot\r\nstand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that\r\n20% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner; thereafter my\r\ncolleague and I will visit your country for disbursement according to\r\nthe percentages\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nTo enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account,you\r\n will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased,indicating\r\n your bank account number and location wherein the money will be\r\nremitted.Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating your interest,I\r\n will send to you the text of the application that you will send to the\r\nUnion Bank\r\nauthority for an approval to submit your claims.\r\n\r\nSend your reply through my direct and private email\r\naddress:abdulkareem_39@rediff.com or abdulkareem_39@tiscali.co.uk indicates your direct Fax and telephone\r\n numbers for effective communication that this transaction needs. Do not\r\n reply through the union bank email address because it belonged to the\r\nsenior staffs for public use.\r\n\r\nPlease note that you are not to appear in person, as every thing\r\nregarding this project will be strictly on documentations and every\r\nbanking documents needed for this transaction will be taken care of by\r\nmy self.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to urgently hearing from you.\r\n\r\nYours Faithfully\r\n\r\nABDULKAREEM USMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnion Bank Of Nig.
