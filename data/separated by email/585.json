All the necessary \ndocuments for the deposit are in my possession I am now a refugee in \nneigbouring african country Ghana due to the fear of been killed by \npresident charles taylor and the unrest in Liberia.\n\nIronically the president of Nigeria  has agreed to grant  president charles\n\ntaylor assylum in Nigeria in\norder to restore peace in liberia so we are trying to do all  we can at\n\nearnest to retrieve the funds from\nthe security company and leave West Africa before he eventually comes to\n\nNigeria.\n\nUpon your response to this mail,i will intimate you on how we can proceed\nto \nget the funds from the security company.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJoseph\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-565", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["joseph.williamvaye@caramail.com", "joseph.williamvaye@caramail.com"], "dc:format": "text/plain;", "dc:identifier": "<200311241336.hAODaeYo007176@idoldancer.mr.itd.UM> ", "dc:subject": "ASSISTANCE", "dc:title": "ASSISTANCE", "dcterms:created": "2003-11-24T13:36:42Z"}
