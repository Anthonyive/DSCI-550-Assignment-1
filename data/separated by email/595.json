I \nam Gregory Kabila, the son of the\nformer head of state \npresident of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire) Mr.\n\nLaurent Desire Kabila. \nI am contacting you in order to ask for your\nassistance \non this confidential Business proposal with full financial \nbenefit for both of us. \nBefore I go into further details please be\ninformed \nthat I am writing without any other person(s) \npre-knowledge of my contacting you on this \ntransaction. Therefore I\nwill appreciate same attitude \nto be maintained all through. \nI have\nthe sum of USD48Million from a secret sale of \nDiamond by my father before\nhe was assassinated by one \nof his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th\n2001, which \nI will like you to receive on my behalf due to \nsecurity\nreasons, as my narration below will explain. \nBut before I continue be\nwell informed that your share \nin this transaction has been calculated at\n25% of the \ntotal sum of USD$48M, 5% for expenses and the rest for \nmy family and me. \nMy father as a real African traditionalist was a \npolygamist thereby having married so many wives, and \nmy mother being\nthe second wife of my father, My \nstepbrother Joseph, who is the current\npresident of my \ncountry, is the son of the first wife and he does not \nhave any knowledge about this deal. \nAlready president Joseph is using\nhis power to \ncolonize all the money and private property, which my \nfather left behind for the whole family. Now my mother \nand I are left\nwith nothing in the inheritance of my \nlate father\u2019s wealth. Our situation\nis seriously \ncritical that we need your assistance to help us \nreceive these funds overseas for proper investment. \nLet me quickly\nassure you the 100% safe proof of this \ntransaction because the diamond\nsales are packaged \nfrom the onset in a pattern that shows no direct trace\n\nor linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the \nmoney is in cash\nand is secured in a security company \nas family treasures, as I don\u2019t want\nto deposit the \nmoney in a financial institution for fear of the funds \nbeing confiscated \nThe consignment will be released within seven (7)\ndays \nof my being in receipt of your reply via my email \naddress\nabove only for security reasons. \nI am waiting for your swift and\nfavorable response, \nand in case you have any question(s), do not hesitate\n\nto contact me. \nBest Regards, \nGregory Kabila. \n\nNB:ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ADDRESS(gregorykabila222@post.cz) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438!\n\n\u0421\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043b\u0438 3000 \u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441 \u043d\u0430\n\nhttp://www.femalelife.bg\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-575", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "2", "dc:creator": ["gregorykabila333@mail.bg", "gregorykabila333@mail.bg"], "dc:format": "text/html; charset=\"windows-1251\"", "dc:identifier": "<1069889941.0af1dafa6d131@www.mail.bg> want", "dc:subject": "PROPOSAL", "dc:title": "PROPOSAL", "dcterms:created": "2003-11-26T23:39:01Z"}
