In an account that belongs to one of our\r\nforeign customer Engr. Lee Yung who died along with his entire family in\r\na concord plane\r\ncrash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the whole life of the\r\npasengeres on board.Engr. Lee Yung was a contractor with the Federal\r\nRepublic of Togo, he supplied and installed equipment to some construction\r\ncompanies in the country.\r\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next\r\nof\r\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless\r\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as\r\nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all\r\nhis\r\nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash\r\nleaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery\r\nthat I and other officials in my department now decided to make this\r\nbusinness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin\r\nor\r\nrelation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody\r\nis coming for it and we don;t want this money to go into the Bank\r\ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\r\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained\r\nunclamed after three years, the money will be transfered into the Bank\r\ntreasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of\r\nkin\r\nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner\r\nand an indigene of Togo cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\r\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in\r\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for\r\nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my\r\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for\r\ndisbursement accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable\r\nthe\r\nimmediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first\r\nto\r\nthe bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank\r\nname, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for\r\neasy and effective communication and location where in the money will be\r\nremitted .\r\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text\r\nof\r\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this\r\ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of\r\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .\r\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\r\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\r\nYour;s faithfully,\r\nDR. FRED WILLIAMS\r\n(Bill and exchange manager)\r\nECOBANK.\r\nN.B.My intention of writing you through email is because I belive it is\r\nvery\r\nconfidential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-650", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"DR WILLIAMS FREDRICK\" <drwilldrick25@fsmail.net>", "DR WILLIAMS FREDRICK <drwilldrick25@fsmail.net>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200401170232.i0H2WE0f024664@informer.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL", "dc:title": "URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL", "dcterms:created": "2004-01-17T02:32:41Z"}
