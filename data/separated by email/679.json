I am the son of Jonas Savimbi the rebel leader in Angola who was short dead on the 25th of February, 2002, by the opposing Angolan Army.\r\n\r\nPLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WEB PAGE FOR IT SAYS ALL.\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm\r\n\r\nBefore the death of my father he deposited 16M (Sixteen million dollars) with a security company in Europe as valuables. All the legal documents for the deposit are with my mother which my father gave to her for safe keeping. After the death of my father I and my family fled to South Africa where we are currently living. And we have been trying to fly to Europe but it has been difficult for us to get visas from Africa. So we want you to help us make claims of this fund ($16m) in Europe as my family beneficiary and transfer the money to your account or any account of your choice before I and my family can get visas to fly down to your country so that we can share this money.\r\n\r\nMy family have agreed to give you 10%, which would be ($1.6Million dollars) of this Money for your assistance, and 87% would be for us and the other 3% would be set aside for any expenses that we may incure during the course of this transaction. And part of our share of 87% would be invested in your country in any profitable business proposed by you. While a large part of our share will also be used to help charity organizations.\r\n\r\nWe have never met, but I want to trust you and please do not let us down when this fund finally gets into your account. Please if you are interested; get to me through my email address to enable me feed you with more details and all necessary documentations.\r\n\r\nPlease treat this as confidential.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nJONAS SAVIMBI\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-658", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"JONAS SAVIMBI\" <sourcetrans@weedmail.com>", "JONAS SAVIMBI <sourcetrans@weedmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<E1AioMu-0006UV-00@bigram.cs.jhu.edu>", "dc:subject": "RE: Assistance/Fund Transfer", "dc:title": "RE: Assistance/Fund Transfer", "dcterms:created": "2004-01-03T07:54:11Z"}
