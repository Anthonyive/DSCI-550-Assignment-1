S. Dollars ($25,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the\nassistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.\n\nThis amount $25.5m represents the balance of the total revenue collections from income tax, mining lease and export duties in respect of diamond mines, expressed as a percentage of total tax revenues (net collections, National Revenue Account from this projects we have been able to secure this\nreasonable amount.$25.5m as commission resulting from over invoice ,hench all the necessary approvals has been completed.\n\nThis amount $25.5m represents the balance of the Estimated revenue total value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual Estimated revenue cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the Tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 20% of the $25.5 million, 70% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confid enti!\n ality.\n\nAlso your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.
