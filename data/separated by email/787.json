I am writing in respect of a\nforeign customer of my bank who perished with his\nwhole families on 25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH\n[ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passengers aboard.\n\nThere is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by\nthis great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a\nwritten or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since\nhis death , I personally has watched with keen\ninterest to see the next of kin but all has proved\nabortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no\nother person knows about this account or anything\nconcerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and\nuntil his death he was the manager of his company.\n\nThe total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ One\nhundred and six million United States Dollar ]. We\nwish to start the first transfer with\n$6,000,000.00[Six million] and open successful\ntransaction without any disappointment from your side,\nwe shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining\nbalance to your account.\nI have secretly discussed this matter with the general\nmanager of the bank who I must involve in order to\nhave a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to\nany foreign bank account which you are going to\nnominate. \n\nOn this note, I decided to seek for a reliable\nforeigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of\nthe fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank\naccount where the fund will be transferred for\nimmediate investment on any viable project as no one\nhas come up to be the next of kin. \n\nThe banking ethics here does not allow such money to\nstay more than six years without claim hence the money\nwill be recalled to the government treasury as\nunclaimed after this long period of domancy. In view\nof this I got your contact through my personal search\nto see if you can assist by providing your safe bank\naccount for the transfer or find a reliable person who\nwill be capable of receiving such amount in his or her\npersonal account.\n\nAt the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fund\nwill be for me, I will give you 20% of the total\ntransfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in\nyour country while the remaining 5% will be set aside\nto settle expenses both parties might incure during\nthe transfer process.\n\nUpon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a\ndetailed information about the transaction.I will not\nfail to bring to your notice that this business is\n100% risk and trouble free and that you should not\nentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer\ncan be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you\napply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from\nthe deceased. When you receive this letter.\n\nKindly send me an e-mail MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS~:\nauditorotto2@netscape.net  You should also include\nyour private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe\ncommunication.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nDr.RICHARD SHUBANE\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
