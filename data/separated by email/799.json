R.O.C.I have urgent and very confidential business\r\nproposition for you.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese\r\nSolid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Smith Lawrence made a numbered time\r\n(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$30,000,000.00\r\n(Thirty Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine\r\nnotification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,\r\nwe sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract\r\nemployers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Smith\r\nLawrence died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I\r\nfound out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace\r\nhis next of kin was fruitless.\r\n\r\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Smith\r\nLawrence did not declare any kin or relations in all his official\r\ndocuments, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of\r\nUS$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being\r\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will\r\never come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of China,\r\nat the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the\r\nownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\r\n\r\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to\r\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Smith Lawrence so that the fruits of\r\nthis old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt\r\ngovernment officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide\r\nimmediately your full names and address so that the attorney will\r\nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in\r\nplace as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney\r\nfor drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary\r\ndocuments and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the\r\ntransfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide\r\nwill then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the\r\nbeneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for\r\nus to share in the ratio of 90% for me and 10% for you.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will\r\nbe done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees\r\nthe successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,\r\nplease reply immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your\r\nresponse, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant\r\ndocuments that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me\r\nyour confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.\r\n\r\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\r\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall\r\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting\r\nyour urgent reply.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\n\r\nMr.Chan Fung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-776", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr.Chan Fung.\" <chanfung123@indiatimes.com>", "Mr.Chan Fung. <chanfung123@indiatimes.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200403291300.i2TD0gI07721@foxfire.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "Urgent From Taiwan.", "dc:title": "Urgent From Taiwan.", "dcterms:created": "2004-03-29T12:57:29Z"}
