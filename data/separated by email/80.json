So,Weare soliciting for your assistance on this matter ;as this stands to be\nthe onlyhope for the future survival of the Family cause we cannot travel out of\nthe countrybecause things are not yet settled. Presently we are seeking assylum in\nNigeria,since it became necessary for us to live my country completly for\nsecurityreasons and the money is here in Nigeria in a security company ;\nfortunately enoughthis company we believe is closer to us and so,we will instruct them to\nairship itto netherland where they have diplomatic immunities for fear of discovery\nwe willdiscuss with the company as regards the money in their Nigerian Office,\nbut for thefact that we have not got any contact from out side Africa for now we are\nunable togive the instructions. This is the more reason why we are contacting you.\nHere inNigeria ;we have limited right to invest this fund ; considering the means\nin whichthe money was acquired, and Nigeria been a African Nation ,Hence we took this\ndecision .In antipation of your assistance we have agreed to give: 30% of\nthe totalsum to you,10% mapped out to cover any expenses that may be incuried in\ncourse ofthe transaction, 60% for me and my family.
