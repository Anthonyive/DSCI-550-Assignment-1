Though I am very rich, I was \nnever generous, I was always hostile to people \nand only focused on my business as that was the only \nthing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I \nnow know that there is more to life than just \nwanting to have or make all the money in the world.\nI believe when God gives me a second chance \nto come to this world I would live my life a \ndifferent way from how I have lived it. Now that God has \ncalled me, I have willed and given most of my \nproperty and assets to my immediate and extended \nfamily members as well as a few close friends.\n\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept \nmy soul hence, I decided to give alms to charity\norganizations, as I want this to be one of \nthe last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have \ndistributed money to some charity organizations in the \nU.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health \nhas deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this \nmyself anymore. I once asked members of my family \nto close one of my accounts and distribute the money \nwhich I have there to charity organization in \nBulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money \nto themselves. Hence, I do not trust them \nanymore, as they seem not to be content with what I \nhave left for them.\n\nThe last of my money which no one knows of \nis the huge cash deposit of $18,000,000,00 that I \nhave with a finance/Security Company \nabroad. I will want you to help me collect \nthis deposit and dispatch it to charity \norganizations.\n\nI have set aside 20% for you and for your \ntime.\n\nGod be with you.\nReply to:naybet@web-mail.com.ar\n\nNaybet Trabelsi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nFREE Email?
