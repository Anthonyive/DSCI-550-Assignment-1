Literally speaking he  gave cover to the\r\nrebel Leaders. This operation was code named: Conflict\r\nDiamond. I cordinated the entire Diamond trade in the\r\nsub-region and this ran into hundreds of Million of\r\nDollar.\r\n\r\nWhile carrying out this operation, I was able to divert\r\nthe sum of US$45,000,000.00 (Forty-Five Million\r\nUnited States Dollars) for my personal benefit, and\r\nit is concelled into 4 Trunk Boxes and deposited as\r\nartifacts materials with ecowas diplomatic Security and cargo unit\r\n in Accra-Ghana.\r\n\r\nThe Security Company does not know the\r\ntrue contents of the consignments. This is only known to you and\r\nme, and I hope you will keep this confidential.\r\n\r\nNow that Charles Taylor is no more in Power, I thought\r\nit wise to move the money out to any  country of the\r\nworld for investment purposes. Now I am contacting you\r\nseeking your assistance to help me in transfering this\r\nmoney to your country. All you need do is to make\r\nnecesary arrangement and fly down to Accra-Ghana, see the\r\nmoney and talk about it.\r\n\r\nAlready, I have the consent of the Security Company Director in Accra-Ghana\r\nwho has agreed to help us move the consignments out through\r\nDiplomatic means to their affilliate office in Europe.\r\n\r\nI am offering you 25% of the total amount involved for\r\nassisting me while 5% is set aside for any expenses that might be incurred during\r\nthe completion of this project, and the remaining 70% will be used for any lucrative\r\ninvestment you will introduce me into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nChief Thomas Nimely yaya.\r\n\r\n\r\nN/B: You can also contact me through my alternative email address:\r\ndr_nimely@latinmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1011", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"yaya\" <dr_tyh@hotmail.com>", "yaya <dr_tyh@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200407210913.i6L9D3Gr023743@granny.mr.itd.UM> in Accra-Ghana=2E", "dc:subject": "IN GOD WE TRUST", "dc:title": "IN GOD WE TRUST", "dcterms:created": "2004-07-21T09:13:07Z"}
