I am contacting you\r\nin view of the fact we will be of great assistance to\r\neach other, likewise developing a cordial business\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nI currently have within my reach the sum of Fifty-five\r\nMillion United States Dollars ($55,000,000,00) cash,\r\nwhich I intend to use for investment purposes\r\nspecifically in your country. This money came as a\r\nresult of a pay-back contract deal between my late\r\nhusband and a Russian firm in our country\u2019s\r\nMulti-billion dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant. The Russian\r\npartners returned my Husband\u2019s share of\r\nUS$55,000,000.00 U.S.D after his death, and lodged it\r\nin my late husband\u2019s Security company of which I am a\r\nDirector Right now, the new Civilian Government has\r\nintensified their probe on my late Husband\u2019s Financial\r\nresources and have frozen our accounts. In view of\r\nthese facts, I acted fast to withdraw the\r\nUS$55,000,000.00 U.S.D from the company\u2019s vault and\r\ndeposited it in a privately owned security safe in my\r\nvillage. I have since declared the security company\r\nbankrupt. No record whatsoever exists concerning the\r\nmoney traceable by the Government because, there is no\r\ndocumentation showing that we received the money from\r\nthe Russians.\r\n\r\nDue to the current situation in the country concerning\r\nthe Government\u2019s attitude towards my husband, it has\r\nbecome quite impossible for me to make use of this\r\nmoney within; thus upon consent, I shall expect you to\r\ncontact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail\r\nabout this transaction.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that your assistance is needed to\r\ntransfer this fund, I propose a commission of 10% (ten\r\npercent) of the total sum to you for the expected\r\nservices and assistance. Your urgent response is\r\nhighly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this\r\nopportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost\r\nindulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily\r\nconfidential, whatever your decision, while I await\r\nyour prompt response.\r\nSend your phone nos for easier communication.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. (MRS) MARIAM  ABACHA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-103", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "2", "dc:creator": ["\"Dr mariam abacha\" <marabac011@hotmail.com>", "Dr mariam abacha <marabac011@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200302080138.h181ccag018447@bluewhale.cs.CU>", "dc:subject": "urgent and confidential.", "dc:title": "urgent and confidential.", "dcterms:created": "2003-02-08T01:38:37Z"}
