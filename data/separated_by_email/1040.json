Literally speaking he  gave cover to the\nrebel Leaders. This operation was code named: Conflict\nDiamond. I cordinated the entire Diamond trade in the\nsub-region and this ran into hundreds of Million of\nDollar.\n\nWhile carrying out this operation, I was able to divert\nthe sum of US$45,000,000.00 (Forty-Five Million\nUnited States Dollars) for my personal benefit, and\nit is concelled into 4 Trunk Boxes and deposited as\nartifacts materials with ecowas diplomatic Security and cargo unit \n in Accra-Ghana. \n\nThe Security Company does not know the\ntrue contents of the consignments. This is only known to you and \nme, and I hope you will keep this confidential.\n\nNow that Charles Taylor is no more in Power, I thought\nit wise to move the money out to any  country of the\nworld for investment purposes. Now I am contacting you\nseeking your assistance to help me in transfering this\nmoney to your country. All you need do is to make\nnecesary arrangement and fly down to Accra-Ghana, see the\nmoney and talk about it.\n\nAlready, I have the consent of the Security Company Director in Accra-Ghana\nwho has agreed to help us move the consignments out through\nDiplomatic means to their affilliate office in Europe. \n\nI am offering you 25% of the total amount involved for\nassisting me while 5% is set aside for any expenses that might be incurred during\nthe completion of this project, and the remaining 70% will be used for any lucrative\ninvestment you will introduce me into.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nChief Thomas Nimely yaya.\n\n\nN/B: You can also contact me through my alternative email address:\ndr_nimely@latinmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1012", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"yaya\" <dr_tyh@hotmail.com> in Accra-Ghana.", "yaya <dr_tyh@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200407210926.i6L9QBIB014121@aquaduct.cs.CU> During the reign of my cousin, Charles Taylor, I was", "dc:subject": "IN GOD WE TRUST", "dc:title": "IN GOD WE TRUST", "dcterms:created": "2004-07-21T09:26:16Z"}
