Sani Abacha. \nBecause of my \nstrategic position in the former Government and also being a \nclose confidant \nof the late Head of State, I was able to acquire personally the \nsum of \n$50,000,000.00 USD ( fifty million United States Dollars only) \npresently \nlodged in a Security Deposit in Europe. I made this money \nlargely through \n\"CONSULTANCY FEE\" and Good Faith Fees\" paid by foreign Oil \ncompanies prior \nto Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other \nLifting/prospecting Right. \nNigeria is the 6th largest Producer/Exporter of Crude Oil in \nthe World. \n\nAs you are probably aware of the fact that Nigeria is prone to \nMilitary coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability \nhas fueled \nhyper Inflation, amongst other problems. I have therefore \nresolved to \ninvest my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties \nand Importation \nof Goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on \nInvestment. \n\nHowever the, present civilian administration of President \nOlusegun Obasanjo \nhas placed a restriction of movement on every member of the \ncabinet of the \npast military government. This is as a result of the panel of \ninquiry \nslated to investigate most of the atrocities perpetrated by the \nlate former \nhead of state. This means that I cannot travel out now till the \npanel \nconclude its investigations which only God knows when that \nwould be. \n\nStraight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present \ntwo major \nproblems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as \n60% of this \nmoney will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a result \nof Government \ndeliberate restrictions on flight of capital Abroad. However \narrangement \nhave been put in place for you to receive this money from a \ntrust worthy \nsecurity Deposit Company in Europe. As soon as you indicate \nyour interest. \nI will send to you the security Code number, certificate of \ndeposit number \nand airway bill number of the Deposit that will serve as the \nonus of proof \nto enable you claim the Money, which is tagged, Diplomatic \nLuggage. \n\nAll I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money \non my behalf \nand help me to invest as aforementioned. \nThere is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as \nthe money will \nbe delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills. \nIf you are interested in assisting me, please send to me by \nemail \nimmediately your preferred contact address where you can be \nreached at any \ntime, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in \na bank \naccount and contact me for necessary arrangements for the \ninvestment of the \nfunds. For your help and assistance in this deal, you will be \nentitled to \n25% of this money in cash or Equity if you wish to join the \nproposed \ncompany. \n\nFinally you are to please urgently send to me through the \nrequired contact address that include your telephone and fax \nnumber), so \nthat I can instruct the West side Deposit Company to go ahead \nwith the \ntransfer to you \n\n\nBest regards, \nSam Aluko\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp://Game.37.com/  <--- Free Games\nhttp://newJoke.com/   <---  J O K E S  ! ! !\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-108", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "2", "dc:creator": ["\"sam aluko\" <samaluko1@37.com>", "sam aluko <samaluko1@37.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain", "dc:identifier": "<200302100224.h1A2Oua08010@mail7.bigmailbox.com>", "dc:subject": "transparent enterprises", "dc:title": "transparent enterprises", "dcterms:created": "2003-02-10T02:24:56Z"}
