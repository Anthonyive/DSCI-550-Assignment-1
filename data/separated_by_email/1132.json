The request of foreigner as next of kin in\r\nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\r\ni agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in\r\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me.\r\nThereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated.\r\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as\r\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.\r\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application . I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\r\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail\r\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\r\nYour faithfully\r\nMr Jerry Moi\r\nBill and Exchange Manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1102", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr Jerry Moi\" <jerrymoi@gowealthy.com>", "Mr Jerry Moi <jerrymoi@gowealthy.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200408281316.i7SDGqLS004606@fate.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "URGENT REPLY NEEDED", "dc:title": "URGENT REPLY NEEDED", "dcterms:created": "2004-08-28T13:26:06Z"}
