We had a foreign client (name with\r\nHeld) who deposited a huge sum of money (US$12million dollars) with our\r\nSecurity Company.\r\n\r\nEventually, this client was among the victims of EGYPT AIR BOEING 767\r\nFLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A but, since then\r\nWe have not had any body coming for the claims as the next of kin. A\r\nSituation I have monitored closely with my position in the Company. Now,\r\nHaving monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before his\r\nDeath, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past four\r\nYear plus, I have removed the file to my private safe.\r\n\r\nI now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin\r\nas every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only\r\nWaiting for a foreigner to enable me move the fund to his account. I\r\nwill need your private telephone and fax numbers and your full name and\r\naddress, company or residential so that I can computerize them to tally\r\nwith the next of kin column in the certificate of deposit.\r\n\r\nThis does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal\r\ndocumentations will be handled by me. I therefore request you to\r\nconfirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with\r\ndetails. Lastly for the immediate take off of this transaction you have to\r\nconfirm your willingness and readiness to assist me retrieves this deposit.\r\n\r\nPlease for your assistance in this transaction you will be entitled\r\nto 20% percent of the total sum and 10% percent will cover all the expenses\r\nincurred in the process of the transaction. I look forward to hearing\r\nfrom you. Contact me with my personal e-mail: jaburime2004@netscape.net\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nJoseph Aburime.\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1113", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Joseph Aburime <jaburime2004@netscape.net>", "Joseph Aburime <jaburime2004@netscape.net>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1", "dc:identifier": "<200409101404.i8AE3xZr006270@neartoearth.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "IMPORTANT", "dc:title": "IMPORTANT", "dcterms:created": "2004-09-10T14:04:23Z"}
