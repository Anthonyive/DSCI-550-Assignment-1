I have an urgent and very\r\nconfidential business proposition for you.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1998, a British Oil consultant/contractor\r\nwith the West African's oil and Solid Minerals\r\nCorporation, Mr. David Van Buskirk made a numbered\r\ntime (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar\r\nmonths, valued at US$35,000,000.00(Thirty five Million United States Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification\r\nto his forwarding address but got no reply. After a\r\nmonth, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered\r\nfrom his contract employers, the West African oil and\r\nSolid Minerals Corporation that Mr.David Van Buskirk\r\ndied in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st\r\nOctober, 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other\r\npassengers on board.\r\n\r\nOn further investigation,I found out that he died\r\nwithout making a WILL, and hitherto, all attempts to\r\ntrace his next of kin was fruitless. Mr.David Van\r\nBuskirk was residing at No 1 Rue de Avenida, G.R.A.\r\nCotonou, Benin Republic.\r\n\r\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered\r\nthat Mr.David Van Buskirk did not declare any kin or\r\nrelations in all his official documents, including his\r\nBank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of\r\nUS$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my\r\nBank and the interest is being rolled over with the\r\nprincipal sum at the end of each year. No one will\r\never come forward to claim it. According to Laws of\r\nBenin, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money\r\nwill be declared frozen and forfeited to the\r\nBenin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\r\n\r\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a\r\nforeigner to stand in as the next of kin or business\r\npartner to Mr.David Van Buskirk so that\r\nthe fruits of this old man's labor will not get into\r\nthe hands of some corrupt government officials. This\r\nis simple, I will like you to provide immediately your\r\nfull names and address,phone and fax numbers so that\r\nthe attorney will prepare the necessary\r\ndocuments and affidavits that will put you in place as\r\nthe next of kin or business partner. We shall employ\r\nthe services of an attorney for drafting\r\nand notarization of the WILL and to obtain the\r\nnecessary documents and letter of\r\nprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\r\n\r\nA bank account in any part of the world that you will\r\nprovide will then facilitate the transfer of this\r\nmoney to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.\r\n\r\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to\r\nshare in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5%\r\nfor expenses incurred in the course of the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nWe could also use an ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY in\r\nEurope to secure this funds and transfer to your\r\naccount in your country.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this\r\ntransaction will be done legitimately and with my\r\nposition as the credit officer guarantees the\r\nsuccessful execution of this transaction. If you are\r\ninterested, please reply immediately to\r\nmy email box.\r\n\r\nPlease send me your confidential telephone and fax\r\nnumbers for easy communication.\r\n\r\nYou should observe utmost confidentiality cum secrecy,\r\nand rest assured that this transaction would be most\r\nprofitable for both of us because\r\nI will require your assistance to invest my share in\r\nyour country.\r\n\r\nAwaiting your urgent reply.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Julliet Abrams\r\nDirect Line: 00229 07 14 19\r\nAlternative email address: <jullietabrams@yahoo.ca>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1155", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"MRS JULLIET ABRAMS\" <julliet02@tfanus.com.er>", "MRS JULLIET ABRAMS <julliet02@tfanus.com.er>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200409231128.i8NBSRM25823@firefox.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "TREAT AS MOST URGENT", "dc:title": "TREAT AS MOST URGENT", "dcterms:created": "2004-09-23T10:27:45Z"}
