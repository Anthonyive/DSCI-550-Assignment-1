As it may intrest you to know, I got your contact \nthrough international business enquiry on internet.\n\nI believe you will be viable and capable to champion a business of such \nmagnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put \nclaim over this fund as the bona fide next of kin to the deceased, get the \nrequired approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put \nin place and directives/needed information will be relayed to you as soon as \nyou indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit \nyour self to this great business opportunity.\n\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \ncountry as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account \nand would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \ntransfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will \nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \nwith affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank and also present a foreign \naccount where he will need the money to be re-transfered into on his request \nas it may be, after due verification and clarification by designated bank \naccount.\n\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On \nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer such as telephone bills \netc, while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please,you have been advised \nto keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from \nservice after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole \nsituation here in the bank until you confirm the money in your account.And \nask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund \naccording to percentages previously indicated and further investment,either \nin your country or any other country you may advice us to invest in.All \nother necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I \nsuggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this \ndeal.\n\nYours faithfully,\nMR OMARU AMINU.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
