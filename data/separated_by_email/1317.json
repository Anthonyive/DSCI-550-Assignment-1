I WORKED WITH THE DEFUNCT REGIME OF SADDAM HUSSAIN AS HIS SECRET ASSISTANCE. WE HANDLE ALL OF HIS FINANCIAL PLANS AND OTHERS.\n \nSIR I KNOW THE IMPRESSION THE WORLD HAS ABOUT ANY BODY FROM MY COUNTRY IRAQ,DURING MY TIME WITH THE FORMER REGIME,I WAS ABLE TO SECRETLY REMOVE THE SUM OF $15MILLION US DOLLARS. WHICH I TRIED TO SEND OUTSIDE IRAQ VIA WIRE TRANSFER BUT THE BANK REFUSED BECAUSE OF FEAR OF BEING IMPOUNDED ON BY THE AMERICANS. SOME HOW I MANAGED TO SEND THE MONEY ACROSS IRAQ VIA SECRET COURIER SERVICE.\n \nTHE FACT THAT THE FUND IS OUTSIDE IRAQ NOW THAT IS MY HAPPINESS, BUT I AM STILL HIDING IN IRAQ TRYING TO SEE HOW I CAN GET OUT, SINCE MY BOSS WAS TOPPLED. I NEED YOUR URGENT AND SINCERE ASSISTANCE TO HELP ME CLEAR THE MONEY FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES TILL I COME OUT OF IRAQ TO MEET WITH YOU.\n \nI WILL LET YOU KNOW THE LOCATION AS WELL AS THE DETAILED INFORMATION AS SOON AS YOU ASSURE ME THAT I CAN RELY ON YOU WITHOUT BEEN BETRAYED. PLEASE FOR SAFETY PUROSE, IT IS BETTER WE LIMIT OUT COMMUNICATION TO EMAIL, FOR NOW.YOU ARE GOING TO GET 20% OF THE FUND FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.\n\nI WILL APPRECIATE IF YOU REPLY ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\n \nTHANKS,\n\nSINCERELY,\n\nMOHAMMED BIN ABDULLAH\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site goddardclan.com\n- http://goddardclan.com\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1287", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["MOHAMMED BIN ABDULLAH <mohaabdul@circlemail.com> ", "MOHAMMED BIN ABDULLAH <mohaabdul@circlemail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "dc:identifier": "<E1CXWNf-0007Rj-3v@server.jkahosting.com>", "dc:subject": "THANKS FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST", "dc:title": "THANKS FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST", "dcterms:created": "2004-11-26T03:02:43Z"}
