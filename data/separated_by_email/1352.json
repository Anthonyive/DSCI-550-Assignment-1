Erick, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the \nSouth Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this \nmedium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and \nprompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion \nCouncil (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave \nyour enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you \nin the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as \na top secret because of the nature of this transaction.\n\nWithin the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and \nwith the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills \ntotaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to \ntransfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said \nfund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are \nhandicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us \nto operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.\n\nThis amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my \nDepartment by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the \nactual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said \namount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign \nbank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa \nfor the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your \nprivate/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.\n\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the \ntransaction, your share of the sum will be 15% of the $26,.5 million, 80% for us and 5% for taxation and \nmiscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost \nsecrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful \nexecution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint \nme. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, \nwhether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign \npartner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make \nthe payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that \nour share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because \nwe will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and \nremember once again that time is of the essence in this business.\n\nI wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDr.T.
