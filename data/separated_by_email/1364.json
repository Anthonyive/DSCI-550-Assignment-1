When my late Husband\r\nwas alive he deposited the sum of $15.5million\r\n(Fifteen Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S Dollars)\r\nwith a Finance Company in oversea.\r\nRecently,my doctor told me that I have only six months\r\nto live due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me\r\nmost is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I\r\ndecided to donate this fund to either a Muslem\r\norganization or devoted Muslim individual that will\r\nutilize this money the way I am going to instructs\r\nherein.\r\nI want this Muslim organization or individual to use\r\nthis money in all sincerity to fund mosques,\r\norphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of\r\nALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views\r\nand belief of the Holy Quran.\r\nThe Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S\r\nbenevolence and this has encourage me to take the bold\r\nstep.I took this decision because I don't have any\r\nchild that will inherit this money and my husband\r\nrelatives are new Christian's converts and I don't\r\nwant a situation where this money will be used in an\r\nUnholy manner.Hence the reasons for this bold\r\ndecision. I know that after death I will be with ALLAH\r\nthe most beneficent and the most merciful.\r\nI don't need any telephone communication in this\r\nregard because of my health, because of the presence\r\nof my husband's relatives around me always. I don't\r\nwant them to know about this development. With ALLAH\r\nall things are possible.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I receive your reply on Email:abdulramat10@yahoo.it <mailto:abdulramat10@yahoo.it> shall give you the contact\r\ninformation of the Finance Company and the country in\r\noversea where the money was deposited.\r\nI will also issue a letter of authority to the Finance\r\nCompany authorizing them that the said fund Have being\r\nwilled to you and a copy of such authorization will be\r\nforwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community\r\nwhere you reside to always pray for me.\r\n\r\nMy happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims\r\nworthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH\r\nmust serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always\r\nbe prayerful all through your life.Any delay in your\r\nreply will give room in sourcing for a Muslim\r\norganization or a devoted Muslim for this same\r\npurpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest\r\nsquarely on your shoulders.\r\nMay the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and protect\r\nyou.\r\nRegards,\r\nMRS Abdul Ramat\r\nPlease your reply should be stictly on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1332", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mrs  Abdul  Ramat\" <abdulramat15@yahoo.it>", "Mrs  Abdul  Ramat <abdulramat15@yahoo.it>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200412210934.iBL9YjIc016833@casino.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "I  NEED    YOUR  COPERATION", "dc:title": "I  NEED    YOUR  COPERATION", "dcterms:created": "2004-12-19T21:34:48Z"}
