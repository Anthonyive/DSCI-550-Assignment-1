We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer\nthe sum of US$40.5M (forty Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) only\ninto his account. \n \nThis fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from a contract awarded by\nus under the budget, allocated to my ministry and the bill was approved\nfor payment by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed.\nCommissioned, the contractor has been paid his actual cost for the\ncontract. We are now left with the balance of US$40.5M as the\nover-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated for our\nown use. \n \nBut under our protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to operate\nor own a foreign account. This is why I contacted you for assistance. We\nhave agreed that you will be entitled for 30% of the total sum, 60% for\nus while 10% for any expenses incurred while transacting the business\nand whatever left from the 10% will be shared equally.\n\nAs you may rightly want to know I got your address from our Chambers of\nCommerce and Industry. I am a top official with the Ministry of\nPetroleum Resources (MPR). We the officials involved in the deal have\nput in many years of services to our ministries. We have been exercising\npatience for this opportunity for so long and to most of us, this is a\nlifetime opportunity we cannot afford to miss. This transaction is very\nmuch free from all sorts of risks. \n \n To enable us get this fund paid into your account, we have to present\nan international business outfit and consequent upon your agreement, we\nwill fax to you the information you will transcribe into your invoice\nand send back to us. As soon as the funds are remitted into your\nnominated account, three officials will visit you to arrange for our\nshare. All these will only take us 10 working days to transfer this fund\ninto your account right from the day we receive the requirements. \n \n NOTE: Your discussion regarding to this transaction should be limited,\nbecause we are still in Government service. Let honesty and trust be our\nwatchwords throughout this transaction. And your \nPrompt reply will be highly appreciated. \n \nBest regards. \n \nJohn Obute\n_____________________________________\nThis mail was sent using pro-webmail.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1359", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"John Obute\" <johnobute@prsp.ro> NOTE: Your discussion regarding to this transaction should be limited,", "John Obute <johnobute@prsp.ro>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\" ", "dc:identifier": "<ia5m6f.3070yt@mail.prosport.ro> To enable us get this fund paid into your account, we have to present", "dc:subject": "Business Partnership", "dc:title": "Business Partnership", "dcterms:created": "2005-01-11T13:15:51Z"}
