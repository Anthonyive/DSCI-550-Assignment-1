PETER LANG \r\nPostfach, 3001 Bern Switzerland \r\n\r\nIMPERATIVE AND PRIVATE.\r\n\r\n I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. PROPOSITION; We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7,500,000.00 (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims for this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by us for the funds (US$7,500,000.00) to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the following; 1. Your name and address 2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers These requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before the transfer can be made. We shall be compensating you with a million dollars on final conclusion of this project, while the rest shall be for us. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please response immediately,\r\nI await your urgent response. \r\nRegards,\r\nMr. Peter Lang \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\nCe Message a \u00e9t\u00e9 compos\u00e9 avec le module WebMail du site \"Le Trublion Picard\"\r\n- http://www.letrublion.info\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1365", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["peter_7lang <peter_7lang@yahoo.com>", "peter_7lang <peter_7lang@yahoo.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "dc:identifier": "<200501121316.j0CDGZaD022051@n6.sivit.org> beneficiaries.
