This money is  currently in a suspense \naccount of the DPR  account with the Debt Reconciliation \nCommittee (DRC). \n\nWe now seek to  process the transfer of this fund officially \nas contract payment to you as a foreign contractor, who will \nbe fronting for us as  the beneficiary of the fund. In this \nway we can facilitate these funds into your nominated \naccount for  possible investment abroad. We are not allowed \nas a matter of  government policy to operate any foreign \naccount to transfer this fund into. \n\nHowever, for your involvement in assisting us with this \ntransferinto your nominated account we have evolved a sharing \nformula as follows: \n(1) 25% for you as the foreign partner \n(2) 75% for I and my colleagues \n\nWe shall be relying on your advice as regard investment of \nour share in any business in your country. Be informed that \nthis business is genuine and 100% safe  considering the \nhigh-power government officials involved.
