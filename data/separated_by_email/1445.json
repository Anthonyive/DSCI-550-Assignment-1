Please\r\naccept my sincere apologies.In bringing this message\r\nof goodwill to you, I have to say that I have no\r\nintention of causing you any pains.\r\n\r\nMy name is SENATOR VICTOR OYOFO,representing Edo North\r\nFederalConstituency,(<http://www.nigeria.gov.ng/government/Nationalass.htm).member>, Pension Funds Committee in the senate of the Federal Republic Of Nigeria. I am writing you to earnestly Solicit your assistance in helping to\r\nreceive some sum of money. I got your e-mail address\r\non the Internet while searching for a reliable and\r\nreputable person to handle this transaction.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSITION: We have the sum of US$25,200,000.00\r\n(Twenty Five Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars)\r\nthat we intend to transfer overseas through the\r\nassistance of a foreign partner.This money came as a\r\nresult of the unclaimed pension funds belonging to a\r\nBritish expatriate petroleum engineer with the\r\nNigerian National Gas Company,Engr.John Bruno. After\r\nall other pensioners have been paid their\r\nentitlements, we deposited this unclaimed sum of\r\nUS$25,200,000.00,with the Debt Management Committee.\r\nIn a bid to make sure Engr.John Bruno gets his due,I\r\nsent a routine notification to his forwarding address\r\nbut got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder\r\nand finally we discovered from his contract employers,\r\nthe Nigerian Gas Company that Engr.John Bruno died,\r\nfrom an automobile accident.\r\n\r\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died\r\nwithout making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his\r\nnext of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further\r\ninvestigation and discovered that Engr.John Bruno did\r\nnot declare any kin or relations in all his official\r\ndocuments. This sum of US$25,200,000.00 is still\r\nsitting in an account of the Debt Management Committee\r\nand the interest is being rolled over with the\r\nprincipal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever\r\ncome forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,at\r\nthe expiration of 2 (two) years,the money will revert\r\nto the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody\r\napplies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal\r\nis that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as\r\nthe next of kin to Engr.John Bruno so that the fruits\r\nof this old man's labour will not get into the hands\r\nof some corrupt government officials.\r\n\r\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately\r\nyour full names,address,telephone and fax numbers so\r\nthat I can prepare the necessary documents and\r\naffidavits that will put you in place as the next of\r\nkin to Engr Bruno. Upon this,we would then obtain the\r\nletter of probate/administration in your favor from a\r\nFederal High Court.A bank account in any part of the\r\nworld that you will provide will then facilitate the\r\ntransfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next\r\nof kin. The money will be paid into your account for\r\nus to share in the ratio of 65% for me and my\r\npartners,30% for you and 5% for any expences\r\nincured,during the course of this transaction.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this\r\ntransaction will be done at the high court and my\r\nposition as a member of the Committee guarantees the\r\nsuccessful execution of this transaction.The fund\r\nshall be transferred to you legally in accordance to\r\nall laid down procedures governing transfer of funds.\r\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via my\r\nemail address. Upon your response, I shall then\r\nprovide you with more details and relevant documents\r\nthat will help you understand the transaction.Please\r\nobserve utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that\r\nthis transaction would be most profitable for both of\r\nus because I shall require your assistance to invest\r\nmy share in your country.\r\n\r\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my email address.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\n\r\nSen.Victor Oyofo.\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1412", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"SENATOR VICTOR OYOFO\" <victoroyofo@netscape.net>", "SENATOR VICTOR OYOFO <victoroyofo@netscape.net>"], "dc:format": "application/octet-stream; name=\"JI.txt\"", "dc:identifier": "<200502061444.j16Eidc9003008@burn2.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "SERVICES REQUIRED.", "dc:title": "SERVICES REQUIRED.", "dcterms:created": "2005-02-06T14:44:35Z"}
