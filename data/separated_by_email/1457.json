Firstly let me introduce\r\nmyself. I am Agnessa Vlachko, personal secretary to\r\nMikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man. Mr.\r\nKhodorkovsky is Chairman & C.E.O Yukos Oil (One of\r\nRussian's Largest Oil Company) and Menatep SBP Bank (A\r\nwell reputable Financial Institution). He was arrested\r\nin October 2003 when masked and armed members of the\r\nsecurity police force stormed his private jet at an\r\nairport in Siberia. Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested for\r\nhis involvement in politics by financing the leading\r\nand opposing political parties (The Union of Right\r\nForces, led by Boris Nemstov and Yabloko, a\r\nliberal/social democratic party led by Gregor\r\nYavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir\r\nPutin. \r\nIn 2003, Sibneft (Another of Russian's Largest Oil\r\nCompany) and Yukos agreed to merge. Mr. Roman\r\nAbramovich who controls Sibneft received US$3bn in\r\ncash and a 26 per cent stake in the merged company in\r\nreturn for his 92 per cent in Sibneft. Mr. Mikhail\r\nKhodorkovsky my boss received the sum of US$106million\r\nin cash. The stated sum was kept in a Financial\r\nInstitution here in Europe by me under instructions\r\nfrom my boss. I was to make payment to an American oil\r\nmerchant on behalf of Mr. Khodorkovsky for his last\r\noil deal before his arrest.\r\nThere has been a bulk freezing of Russian Bank\r\nAccounts linked to the Yukos Company that is why\r\nforeign aid is required. Presently, the Russian court\r\nhas frozen the assets of Yukos due to an unpaid tax\r\nclaim during 2000 and the company may be forced into\r\nbankruptcy. This is all an attempt by the Russian\r\ngovernment to bring about the total destruction of\r\nYukos and erode the personal wealth of Mr.\r\nKhodorkovsky. Fear of arrest has forced all the firm's\r\ntop executives to remain outside Russia. I have\r\npresently relocated to London. My boss has therefore\r\ninstructed me in confidence to look for a reputable\r\nand capable individual who can assist us receive the\r\nUS$106million for safekeeping and subsequent\r\ninvestment. All matters will be handled discreetly for\r\nsafety of the funds. \r\n\r\nAs personal secretary to Mr. Khodorkovsky, I have all\r\nthe necessary documentations to lay claim to this fund\r\non your behalf. You will be compensated with 10% of\r\nthe total sum for your partnership. You will be\r\nrequired to stand as the beneficiary of the quoted\r\nsum, while I arrange all relevant documents, which\r\nwill enable the European Bank release the sum to you.\r\nOnce I am convinced of your preparedness to assist in\r\nconcluding this transaction I shall provide you with\r\nmore details. Please reach me immediately through the\r\nemail address  a_vlachkoc11@excite.com sending to me your\r\nconfidential telephone and fax number(s) so that I can\r\nreach you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you as I look forward to your earliest response.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nAgnessa Vlachko.\r\n\r\nAPEX  TRUST\r\n\n\n\n\nIf you reply to this message, keeping the Subject: header intact,\nMailman will discard the held message.
