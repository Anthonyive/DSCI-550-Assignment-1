Getting your contact was not\nan easy task since my client ordered me to seek a partner\nvery far away and I went to the institute of International\nBusiness to apply and I paid them the charges. \nI Barrister Miroslav Vlado, representing Mr. Mikhail\nKhodorkovsky (M.k.) of Russia. He is one time the richest\nman in Russia and the head of YUKO'S OIL till that\nunfaithful day that they got him arrested and since then\nall his accounts and known businesses have been\nconfiscated. \nI would like to ask for your partnership in re-profiling\nfunds over US$423 million. I will give the details, but in\nsummary, the funds are coming via bank transfer. Please\nnote that as an attorney I want a very straight forward and\nGod fearing person, as this is a legitimate transaction and\nnot a Childs play. You will be paid 10% for your\n\"management fees\". \nYou can log into this website to find out more about my\nclient: <<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3213505.stm>>\n\nif you are interested, please write back and I will provide\nfurther instructions. Keep this confidential as you could\nalso reach me on \"mv_atexfirm@yahoo.co.uk\"\nFinally, please note that this must be concluded next week.\nI look forward to it. \nRegards, \nMiroslav Vlado.  \n(Barrister and Solicitors Esq.)\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1455", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mirolsav Vlado\" <mvsolicitors@kayafmmail.co.za>", "Mirolsav Vlado <mvsolicitors@kayafmmail.co.za>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"ISO-8859-1\"", "dc:identifier": "<web-645806205@mail01.infosat.net>", "dc:subject": "Re-profiling", "dc:title": "Re-profiling", "dcterms:created": "2005-02-22T22:33:20Z"}
