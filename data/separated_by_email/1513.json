I have a proposal for your consideration and will be glad if you would give your co-operation so that we could exploit the opportunity together.\nThe agent of an oversea penticostal church opened an account with our bank at the time of establishment some years back. The account is for the purpose of receiving support donations for the church.\nCuriously, this account was only operated for one year and abandoned. For the past years, donations have been pouring into the account from ignorant donors. I investigated and found out that the church opened similar bank accounts in many countries and as it grew, some of the accounts were abandoned especially in countries where the church had no physical presence. It was also discovered that some of the evangelist/agents overseeing the accounts were disgruntled at how church finances were managed and had\nto leave the church.\nI have been monitoring this bank account for some years; - from the time when there was only US$500,000 in the account to now when the account has over US$15Million. The interesting thing is that the donations are unanimous; so even the donors keep their identity secret. I and my top colleagues at the bank have agreed to treat this money as an abandoned account. They mandated me to source for a foreign partner to whom the bank could bequeath the money for charity.\nThe financial laws of Nigeria is liberal in this respect as it permits the banks to bequeath such abandoned bank accounts to individuals or organizations that will use the fund for charitable courses.\nMy reason for writing you is to solicit your co-operation so that you could\nbe presented as the individual to whom this money will be bequeathed. We propose a 50/50 sharing arrangement between you and the CONTINENTAL BANK GROUP. If you accept, please confirm to me by a return email so that I can brief you on how we can harness this\nopportunity to our mutual benefit. You should also provide me with your telephone\nnumber to enable me call you.\nAccept my best wishes as I await your positive reply.\n\n\nJames William\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u00a1Viaja!\n Disfruta estos Puentes de las mejores vacaciones, vuelos y hoteles!\nhttp://viajes.wanadoo.es/\n\n\n\n\nIf you reply to this message, keeping the Subject: header intact,\nMailman will discard the held message.
