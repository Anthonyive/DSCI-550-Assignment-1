This is why I need your help so that I\ncan use you or your company to process the release of\nthe fund as if you are reciving a payment of an\nexecuted contract.\n\nPlease let me know about yourself/company and also let\nme know if you can be able to receive the money on my\nbehalf and invest it in your company or any good and\nprofitable business in your country without exposing\nme, so as to give you all the details needed to make\nthe money transferred to you. \n\nYour share will be 40% for your assistance, while I\nwill take 55% and 5% will take care of any expenses\nthat will be incurred in the cause of transfer.\n\nPlease write back if only you know you are capable\nenough to execute this project with me.\n\nPlease this transaction requires utmost\nconfidentiality.
