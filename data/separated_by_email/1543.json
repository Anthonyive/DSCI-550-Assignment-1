CHEUNG PUI \nHang Seng Bank Ltd \nSai Wan Ho Branch\n\n171 Shaukiwan Road \nHong Kong. \ncontact:Let me start by\nintroducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung\u00a0 Puidirector of operations of the\nHang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a obscured business suggestion\nfor you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was\nwith the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit\nfor 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred\nThousand United\u00a0 State Dollars($24,500,000) only in my branch. Upon\nmaturity several notice was sent to him,even during the war early last year.\nAgain another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We\nlater find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war\nin bomb blast that hit their home. \nAfter further investigation it was\nalso discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his\nofficial papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also\nconfided in me the last time he was at my office\u00a0 that no one except me\nknew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred\nThousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever\ncome forward to claim \nit. What bothers me most is that according to the\nto the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years the funds will revert to\nthe ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the\nfunds. \nAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like\nyou as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that\nyou will be able to receive his funds. \nWHAT IS TO BE DONE: \nI want\nyou to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out\nsuccessful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary\ndocument that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all\nthat is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your\nFull Names and Address so that the attorney can \ncommence his job. After\nyou have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for\nclaims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of\nprobate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be\nprovided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are\ngoing adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the\nnecessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost confidentiality in\nall matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to\nyour nominated bank \naccount we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me,\n30% for you. \nShould you be interested please send me your full names and\ncurrent residential address and I will prefers you\u00a0 reach me on the\nemail address cheungpuibank@netscape.net and\nfinally after that i shall provide you with more details \nof this\noperation.
