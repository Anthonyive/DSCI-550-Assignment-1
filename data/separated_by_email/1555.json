Please let me introduce myself to you. I am Lt. Gen Dan Broswer , a former Director of Logistic and Planning in Federal Republic of Liberia.\r\nBefore the heat of the war in my country Liberia, I was handed (Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) USD20.5M for the purchase of Military Eqiupments, Arms and Amminition from Russia.\r\n\r\nThe condition that befell the former government of Charles Taylor did not permit me to use the money for the purpose. And this fund has already been diplomatically transfered into a foreign Security Company for security reasons. Which I will give you all the necessary information and the documents covering this money as soon as I hear from you; then we can discuss about the percentage I am going to offer you after the transaction.\r\n\r\nPresently, I am in Dakar, Senegal where I have been granted refugee since the intervation of United Nation Organization in my country. Now, I intend to go into a Real Estate Business with this money I deposited in a Security Company since I am no longer into power.\r\n\r\nBut please, you have to understand that a transaction of this magnitude and nature requires absolute secrecy so that no one else will hears about it especially, our mutual agreement to utilize this money for purchasing of Military Eqiupments as stated in the paragraph above.\r\n\r\nThanks as I solicite your humble and truthful assistance in this financial transaction; and looking forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nWith best regards.\r\nSincerely,\r\nLt. Gen. Dan Broswer\r\ndbroswer@lycos.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1521", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"DANIEL BROSWER\" <dbroswer@yahoo.co.uk>", "DANIEL BROSWER <dbroswer@yahoo.co.uk>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200503201728.j2KHSadS006019@brazil.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "Reply Soon!!!!!!!!!!", "dc:title": "Reply Soon!!!!!!!!!!", "dcterms:created": "2005-03-20T17:28:20Z"}
