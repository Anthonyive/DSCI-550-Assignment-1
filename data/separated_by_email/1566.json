I wish to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you. I am mike kamokai, I am writing to inform you of my desire to invest, and to buy a house in your country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I am the first son of Chief Joseph kamokai who was the former Para month ruler of saradungu village of Sierra-Leone .my father was attacked by the R U F rebels on his way to Lucia a northern part of Sierra-Leone and my father sustained injuries and he died three days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore he died he revealed to me about the two boxes containing $50 million u s dollars. Which he deposited with a security company in Ghana for safe keeping. My father did not disclose the content of the boxes to the security company. To avoid the officials from raising eye brows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently I and my mother are here in Ghana to notify the security company of the claims, and we are staying in the refugee camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore I want you to lecture me on how best we can invest this money in your country, because my father told me that it is dangerous to invest in Africa to avoid suspicions, and due to market instabilities coupled with economic and political situation facing Africa for your assistance myself and my mother have agreed to offer you 20% of the total amount of the money.\r\n\r\nWe have all the vital documents covering the deposit and the ownership which I can send to you.\r\n.\r\nNote, I have never disclosed this transaction to anybody apart from you. So please keep it very very confidential. Call me on this number line 00233244774480.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n Best regards.\r\nMike kamokai\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1532", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Mike  Kamokai\" <m_kamokai2004@yahoo.co.uk> I am the first son of Chief Joseph kamokai who was the former Para month ruler of saradungu village of Sierra-Leone =2Emy father was attacked by the R U F rebels on his way to Lucia a northern part of Sierra-Leone and my father sustained injuries and he died three days=2E", "Mike  Kamokai <m_kamokai2004@yahoo.co.uk>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" Best regards=2E", "dc:identifier": "<0MKv22-1DEBdu1vmC-0001M7@mx.perfora.net>", "dc:subject": "Proposal", "dc:title": "Proposal", "dcterms:created": "2005-03-23T19:35:59Z"}
