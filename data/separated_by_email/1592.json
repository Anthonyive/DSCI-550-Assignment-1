But because of the unstable political\nproblems here last year I instructed the security\ncompany to transfer the consignment to their\naffilliate office in Europe, the fund is presently in\nEurope now waiting for clearance.\n\nI am just 18 years old and a university undergraduate\nand really don't know what to do.Now I want you to\nhelp me claim and transfer the fund for investment in\nyour country because I have suffered a lot of set\nbacks as a result of incessant political crisis here\nin Ivory coast.The death of my father actually brought\nsorrow to my life.\n\nI am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in\nthis regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly\nregarded.\n\nNow permit me to ask these few questions:\n1. Can you honestly help me.\n2. Can I completely trust you? \n3. What percentage of the total amount in question \n\nwill be good for you after the money is in your\ncustody. \nPlease,Consider this and get back to me as soon as\nposible.\n\nThank you so much and God bless you.\n\nMy sincere regards,\n\nMiss Hussam mattin,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nYahoo!
