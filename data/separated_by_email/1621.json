WANG QIN\nHANG SENG BANK LTD.\nDES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,\nCENTRAL HONG KONG,\nHONK KONG.\n\nDear Sir,\nLet me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin\ncredit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a\nconcealed business suggestion for you.\nBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client General.\nIbrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also\nbusiness man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18\ncalendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five\nHundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my\nbranch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him,\neven during the war early this year. Again after the\nwar another notification was sent and still no\nresponse came from him. We later find out that the\nGeneral and his family had been killed during the war\nin bomb blast that hit their home.\n\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered\nthat Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of\nkin in his official papers including the paper work of\nhis bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last\ntime he was at my office that no one except me knew of\nhis deposit in my bank. So, Twenty millions Five\nHundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying\nin my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim\nit. What bothers me most is that according to the to\nthe laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the\nfunds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong\nGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I\nwill like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of\nkin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to\nreceive his funds. \n\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned\nout so that we shall come out successful. I have\ncontacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary\ndocument that will back you up as the next of kin to\nGen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at\nthis stage is for you to provide me with your Full\nNames and Address so that the attorney can commence\nhis job. After you have been made the next of kin, the\nattorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf\nand secure the necessary approval and letter of\nprobate in your favor for the move of the funds to an\naccount that will be provided by you.\n\nThere is no risk involved at all in the matter as we\nare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney\nwill prepare all the necessary documents. Please\nendeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters\nconcerning this issue.\nOnce the funds have been transferred to your nominated\nbank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for\nme, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred\nduring the course of this operation. \nShould you be interested please send me your full\nnames, current residential address and I will provide\nyou with more details of this operation.\nI will prefers you to reach me on this email below\nqin05@sify.com, for security purpose.\n\nYour earliest response to this letter will be\nappreciated.\nKind Regards\nMr. Wang Qin\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site\n- http://yoursite.com\n\n\n\n\nIf you reply to this message, keeping the Subject: header intact,\nMailman will discard the held message.
