This sum of US$14.6,000,000.00 is still sitting in her Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim this fund.\n\n\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mrs. Ann Parker. so that the fruits of this woman's labuor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your \n1.Your full names \n2.Contact address\n3.Your direct telephone and Fax number\n4.Your age\n5.Your marital status\nBased on the following informaion been provide by you i shall prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.\n\n\nI will drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/ administration in your favour for the transfer. I would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mrs. Ann Parker. to travel and claim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe which is used by her bank as an offshore payment center to the bank. The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you then 10% for any expensee that may come up. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by me with my position as Attorney guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.\n\n\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\n\n\nAwaiting your urgent reply\n\n\nThanks and regards.\n\n\nBarr.
