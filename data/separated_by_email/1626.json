As a result of the on-going problem in my country, I am saddled with\r\nproblems of my ill-health of protracted diabetes and high blood pressure which is getting of increase in\r\nthe recent times, more importantly getting a trust worthy individual abroad to receive the sum of\r\nUS$7million on our behalf.\r\nDue to this war crises presently in my city Monrovia our home town, I managed to sneak myself and my son\r\nDavid 23 years of age and four other of my daughters out of Monrovia to Dakar senegal for safety. We were\r\nsneaked into Dakar Senegal through the land boarder by the help of some\r\ngovernment militant group. After the killing of my husband by the\r\nrebels, we decided to come down here to Dakar senegal to secure the deposit in a\r\nfinance firm by my husband and to further look for a trust worthy\r\nindividual abroad to receive these deposit which has being deposited here in Dakar\r\nSenegal before he was eventually killed by the heartless rebels. I feel\r\nconfident therefore to introduce myself to you based on this problem and our present condition\r\nas all our foreign contacts and connections got lost during this crises,\r\nall properties burnt by the rebels. I am desperately in need to move and re-locate this huge deposit to your\r\ncountry for safe keeping as this is the only wealth remaining for the future survival and well being of my large family.\r\nFor your percentage for assistance, a negotiable percentage will be\r\ndiscussed as soon as I receive your response based on this plea for your\r\nassistance as our lives are highly in danger due to this problem. I pray and plead for your help. You can email me back for\r\nfurther clarifications God bless you as you respond to my plea for\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nMrs Lydia Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1591", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"from Mrs.Johnson\" <hdg@yahoo.com>", "from Mrs.Johnson <hdg@yahoo.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200504231356.j3NDu75O003066@panther.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "from Mrs.Johnson", "dc:title": "from Mrs.Johnson", "dcterms:created": "2005-04-23T13:57:12Z"}
