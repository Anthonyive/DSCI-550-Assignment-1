I am a widow being that I lost my\r\nhusband a couple of months ago. My husband was a serving director of the\r\nCocoa exporting board until his death. He was assassinated on August 2003\r\nby the rebels following the political uprising.\r\nBefore his death he deposited the sum of $14.5M fourteen Million five hundred\r\nthousand USD in a private security Company in Europe which was for the importation\r\nof cocoa processing machines. Note, according to my late husband the money\r\nis in a trunk box and he did not disclose to the security company the real\r\ncontent of the box he did it to reduce the cost of demurrage fees and for\r\nthe safety of the fund according to him, he declared to the security company\r\nthat the box contains a family valuables.\r\nI want you to do me a favour, to help me invest this fund in a profitable\r\ninvestment in your country as I do not have any knowledge of investment,\r\nthat will be after we retrieve it from the security company. For your efforts,\r\nyou shall either choose to receive 25% of the total fund or go into equal partnership\r\ninvestment with me in your country. My interest is in areas, like real estate\r\nand industrial production.\r\nThis is my reason for writing to you. Please if you are willing to\r\nassist me and my only son Francoise, indicate your interest in\r\nreplying soonest. E-email : (grace_kopi@yahoo.com <mailto:grace_kopi@yahoo.com>\r\n)\r\nThanks and best regards .\r\nMrs.GRACE KOPI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1638", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"GRACE KOPI\" <gracekopi@z6.com>", "GRACE KOPI <gracekopi@z6.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200505181553.j4IFrI2C019775@score.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "GREETINS FORM GRACE", "dc:title": "GREETINS FORM GRACE", "dcterms:created": "2005-05-18T15:53:17Z"}
