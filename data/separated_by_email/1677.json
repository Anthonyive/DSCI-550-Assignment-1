My name is BarristerPhilip Wilson\u00a0Esq,legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000.

Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin. \n\u00a0\nAfter the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me.\n\u00a0\nIt was while i was searching for his family records on the internet\n that i came across your contact.I have searched through almost all the genealogy site that you can think of both in the \nRussia,USA and all the possible places I thought my clients would have possibly had a family member. Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your name, while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of my client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me because of the status quo. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account,\n hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. \n\n\nI guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n\nBarrister\u00a0\u00a0Philip Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
