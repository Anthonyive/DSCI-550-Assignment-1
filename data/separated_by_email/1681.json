If i don't remit\r\nthis money immediately, it will get lost(may be it\r\nwill go into the pockets of the corrupt government\r\nofficials who will never use it for any reasonable\r\nthing at all).I dont want to miss this opportunity\r\nbecause it comes ones in a life time.\r\n\r\nThe amount involved is $28.5 million(USD)Twenty eight\r\nmillion,five hundred United States Dollars and no\r\nother person knows about this account.
