I am certainly sure that \nhe has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account , no beneficiary and \nnobody will come again for the claim of this money. \n\nIt is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the \naccount holder which I will provide to you if you are interested, therefore \nI need your cooperation in this transaction. The difference in country of \norigins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction. This money \nwill remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund \nout to a foreign account. \n\nI will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to \nclaim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide \nyour safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement that \nwill ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to \nnominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct \nphone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in \nhandling this transaction. \n\nAt the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of the total \ntransfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any \nexpenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The \nfund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer \nUSD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you after the \nsuccessful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will  \nhave the remaining balance  of USD28,223 Million transferred to your account \nonly after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any \ndisappointment from your side. \n\nHave a nice day as I entrust this transfer into your hands. \n\nFinaly reply to this e-Mail address bellow if you are willing to do this \nbusiness with me. <jenifdavix@timemail.com> \n\nBest Regards,\nMr. Jenif Davix.\nFAX:874-76-2533361\nTEL:874-76-2533360\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1664", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:format": "text/plain; format=flowed; charset=\"utf-8\"", "dc:identifier": "<E1DbiJ4-0003dR-M1@mk-webmail-1.b2b.uk.tiscali.com>", "dc:subject": "VERY IMPORTANT RESPOND BACK", "dc:title": "VERY IMPORTANT RESPOND BACK", "dcterms:created": "2005-05-27T17:07:34Z"}
