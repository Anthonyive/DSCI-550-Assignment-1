I am the son of Jonas Savimbi the rebel leader in Angola who was short dead on the 25th of February, 2002, by the opposing Angolan Army.Before the death of my father he had deposited the sum of $27,000,000.00(Twenty Seven Million Dollars)in a Security Company in West Africa (Ghana) Which all the legal documents for the deposit are with me which my father gave to me for safe keeping.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of my father I and my family fled to West Africa (Ghana) where we are currently living. And we have been trying to fly out of Africa but it has been difficult for us to get visas from Africa. So we want you to help us make claims of this fund ($27M) in Ghana as my family beneficiary and transfer the money to your account or any account of your choice before I and my family can get visas to fly down to your country so that we can share this money.\r\n\r\nMy family have agreed to give you 10%, which would be ($2.7 Million dollars)of this Money for your assistance, and 87% would be for us and the other 3% would be set aside for any expenses that we may incure during the course of this transaction. And part of our\r\nshare of 87% would be invested in your country in any profitable business proposed by you.\r\nWhile a large part of our share will also be used to help charity organizations. We have never met, but I want to trust you and please do not let us down when this fund finally gets into your account.And I want you to promise me that you will not run away with the money or sit on it.\r\n\r\nPlease if you are interested; get to me through my email address to enable me feed you with more details and all necessary documentations.Please treat this as confidential\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nJOHN SAVIMBI\r\nN/B THIS MY ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ADDRESS( johnsavimbi8@yahoo.co.uk)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1701", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"JOHN SAVIMBI\" <johnsavimbi8@yahoo.co.uk>", "JOHN SAVIMBI <johnsavimbi8@yahoo.co.uk>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200506210815.j5L8F5UC001304@brazil.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "GOD BLESS YOU !", "dc:title": "GOD BLESS YOU !", "dcterms:created": "2005-06-21T08:14:57Z"}
