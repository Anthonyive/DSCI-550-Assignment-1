On the 21st of August 2000, my\nclient,his wife and their three children were involved in a\ncar accident along Sagamu Express Road. All occupants of\nthe vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I\nhave made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any\nof my clients extended relatives, this has also proved\nunsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I\ndecided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate\nany member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted\nyou.\n\n\nI have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money\nand property left behind by my client before they get\nconfiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where\nthese huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the bank\nwhere the deceased had a deposit valued at about Ten\nMillion United States Dollars($U.S10,000,000) has issued me\na notice to provide the next of kin or have the account\nconfiscated within the next ten official working days.\nSince I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives\nfor over two years now.\n\n\nI seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of\nthe deceased Since you are from the same country so that\nthe proceeds of this account valued at Ten Million United\nStates Dollars ($U.S10,000,000) can be paid to you and then\nyou and me can share the money. 65% to me and 25% to\nyou,while 10% should be for expenses or tax as your\nGovernment may require, I have all necessary legal\ndocuments that can be used to back up any claim we may\nmake. All I require is your honest Cooperation to enable us\nsee this deal through. I guarantee that this will be\nexecuted under a legitimate arrangement that will protect\nyou from any breach of the law. \n\n\n\nBest regards, \nBarrister Ade Williams\nKINDLY CALL ME FOR ORAL CLERIFICATION.+234 1 759781\u00a0 OR\nREPLY TO avingg@hotmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nEncuentra tu casa r\u00e1pida y c\u00f3modamente.
