I want to assure you that I have concluded all local modalities for the successful completion of this within 10 banking days of your agreement to proceed with me as the required assistance is perfected to be 100% risk free. Please reply me to enable us proceed. \r\n\r\nI expect your urgent response and if in the affirmative, I shall advice you on what we need to do.\r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\n\r\nFrank Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1750", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["fjones015@o2.pl made it very difficult to locate anyone who is directly related to the d=", "fjones015@o2.pl"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-2\";", "dc:identifier": "<20050717184114.D9C86214031@rekin14.go2.pl>", "dc:subject": "RIGHT OF REPLY", "dc:title": "RIGHT OF REPLY", "dcterms:created": "2005-07-17T18:41:14Z"}
