Though I am\nvery rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile\nto people and only focused on my business as that was\nthe only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just\nwanting to have or make all the money in the world.I\nbelieve when God gives me a second chance to come to\nthis world I would live my life a different way from\nhow I have lived it.\nNow that God has called me, I have willed and given\nmost of my property and assets to my immediate and\nextended familymembers as well as a few close\nfriends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my\nsoul so, I have decided to give alms to charity\norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last\ngood deeds I do on earth.\nSo far, I have distributed money to some charity\norganizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.\nNow that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot\ndo this myself anymore. I once asked members of my\nfamily to close one of my accounts and distribute the\nmoney which I have there to charity organization in\nBulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money\nto themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as\nthey seem not to be contended with what I have left\nfor them.\n\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge\ncash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I have\nwith a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want\nyou to help me collect this deposit and despatch it to\ncharity organizations.\nI have set aside 20% for you and for your time.\nGod be with you.\nDAVID ELLIS\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1765", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["David Ellis <david_ellis_5@sify.com>", "David Ellis <david_ellis_5@sify.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1", "dc:identifier": "<1122136304.42e270f03cd58@webmail.namezero.com> RCVD_IN_BL_SPAMCOP_NET,RCVD_IN_SBL,SUBJ_ALL_CAPS autolearn=no", "dc:subject": "IN GOOD FAITH", "dc:title": "IN GOOD FAITH", "dcterms:created": "2005-07-23T16:31:44Z"}
