The above sum\nresulted from an over-invoiced contract, executed,\ncommissioned and paid for about five years (5) ago by\na foreign contractor. This action was however\nintentional and since then the fund has been in a\nsuspense account at The Reserve Bank Of South Africa Apex\nBank. \n\nWe are now ready to transfer the fund overseas and\nthat is where you come in. It is important to inform\nyou that as civil servants, we are forbidden to\noperate a foreign account; that is why we require your\nassistance. The total sum will be shared as follows:\n70% for us, 25% for you and 5% for local and\ninternational expenses incidental to the transfer. \n\nThe transfer is risk free on both sides. I am an\naccountant with the Department of Minerals and Energy \nCorporation (DME). If you find this proposal\nacceptable, we shall require the following documents: \n\n(a) Your bank name, telephone, your account details and fax\nnumbers. \n\n(b) Your private telephone and fax numbers - for\nconfidentiality and easy communication. \n\n(c) Your letter-headed paper stamped and signed. \n\nAlternatively we will furnish you with the text of\nwhat to type into your letter-headed paper, along with\na breakdown explaining, comprehensively what we\nrequire of you. \n\nPlease reply urgently through the below email address.\nEmail: mmorebe@zwallet.com\nTel + 27 83 511 9309 \n\nBest regards \nMr.M Morebe\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1791", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["miketami@executivemail.co.za", "miketami@executivemail.co.za"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=US-ASCII", "dc:identifier": "<200508092110.j79LArpm028103@flawless.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "Thanks For Your Concern", "dc:title": "Thanks For Your Concern", "dcterms:created": "2005-08-09T21:10:42Z"}
