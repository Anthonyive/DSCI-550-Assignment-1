Can you handle this project?\n\n2. Can I give you this trust?\n\n3. What will be your commission?\n\nIf you can sponsor this transfer. Consider this and get back to me as\nsoon as possible with the following.\n\n1.your full name\n\n2.your full address\n\n3.your age/occupation\n\n4.your direct phone/fax numbers for easy communication\n\n5.your banking details in which this money will be paid into.\n\nWe shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and\nnotarization of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A \nbank\naccount in any part of the world that you will provide will then\nfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary|next of kin.\n\nFinally, it is our humble prayer that the information as contained\nherein be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy\nit deserves. I Expect your urgent response if you can handle this\nproject. Call me at this direct line +2348023434277 after sending a mail for\nconfirmation. I am expecting your urgent response as soon as you\nreceive my message.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nMR LEONARD OKOBI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1794", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"leonard okobi\" <leonardokobi@leonardokobi.org>", "leonard okobi <leonardokobi@leonardokobi.org>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; format=flowed", "dc:subject": "MR LEONARD OKOBI", "dc:title": "MR LEONARD OKOBI", "dcterms:created": "2005-08-12T12:38:05Z"}
