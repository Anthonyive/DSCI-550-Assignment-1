On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and\nhis present balance is valued at US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States\n Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we\nsent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further\ninvestigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was\nfruitless, as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not \ndeclare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still \nlying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now, no one \nwill ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money \nwill revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed. \n\nConsequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all \nwe need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would\nput you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for the drafting\nand notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your \nfavour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you.\n\nThere is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager \nguarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email.\n\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall \nstill require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our \nshare . \n\nAwaiting your urgent reply.\n\nMr.Dayo Naps\n234 80 372 20807\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-181", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["dayonaps04@aol.com", "dayonaps04@aol.com"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "dc:identifier": "<MAIL6eoHvEmsgTFsFOU0003461d@mail.matsuoka.com.cn>", "dc:subject": " ", "dc:title": " "}
