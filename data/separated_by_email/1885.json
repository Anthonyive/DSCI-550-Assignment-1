My name is Mr. John Naveed, a merchant \nfrom Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Oesophageal cancer. It \nhas defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about \na few months to live, according to medical experts.\n\nI have not particularly lived my life so well as a good person, as I never \nreally cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very \nrich, I was never Generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused \non my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all \nthis, as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or \nmake all the money in the world.\n\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would \nlive\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me \nand at the point of death, I have willed and given most of my property and \nassets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close \nfamily friends.\n\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul, so I have decided to \ngive\nalms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good \ndeeds\nI do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity \norganizations\nin the U.A.E, Malaysia and some countries in Africa. Now that my health has \ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do so many things by myself anymore.\n\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute \nthe\nmoney that I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, \nthey\nrefused and selfishly kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust \nthem anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for \nthem.\n\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of \neleven\nmillion dollars $11,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company \nabroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to \nvarious charity organizations. I have set aside some part of this deposit \nfor you as compensation for your time and any inconvenience this will cost \nyou. You can also contact me on mr_johnnaveed@yahoo.co.uk\n\nGod be with you.\nMr. John Naveed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1848", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"John Naveed\" <jnaveed1@hotmail.com>", "John Naveed <jnaveed1@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; format=flowed", "dc:subject": "DEAR BELOVED", "dc:title": "DEAR BELOVED", "dcterms:created": "2005-09-20T13:28:07Z"}
