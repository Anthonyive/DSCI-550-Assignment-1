Which My bank, now expects a next-of-kin to claim as the beneficiary of the funds, efforts has been made by my Bank to get in touch with the The deceased's Family or relative but to no avail. \n\nBased on the perceived possibility of not being able to locate The deceased's Family or relative and next-of-kin, the management under the influence of our chairman and the board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and channeled to an unknown account. It is based on this that I have contacted you to stand as the next-of-kin of The deceased or relative so that the funds, will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary /next-of-kin to the deceased. \n\nAll documents, and proof to enable you get the funds have been carefully worked out as I have secured from the different offices concerned for the smooth transfer of the fund to your nominated account. It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with 30% of the remitted funds.\n \nIf this proposal satisfies you, please reach me either by mail or phone: +31 64 920 8093, for more clarification about how this will be done. \n\nAnd also provide me the following information:\n\nNAMES IN FULL:\nCONTACT ADDRESS:\nTEL:\nFAX:\nOCCUPATION:\n\nNB: Reply me using my private mail address: gblacwell@walla.com\nYours faithfully, \n\nGordon Blackwell\n+31 64 920 8093 \nAMSTERDAM-NETHERLANDS. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site\n- http://yoursite.com\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1935", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["The Desk of Gordon Blackwell", "Gordon Blackwell <gblacwell@walla.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "dc:identifier": "<20051104215416.277AE39877A@p15112384.pureserver.info>", "dc:subject": "In Good Faith", "dc:title": "In Good Faith", "dcterms:created": "2005-11-04T21:54:16Z"}
