I happen to have managed a\nparticular account for a Resident Foreigner, here in\nthe United Kingdom, who accidentally died Interstate, \nleaving in our care a reasonable amount in a\nDomiciliary United States Dollars Account. The\nHighly confidential nature of our client and our\nBusiness Confidential disposition on Client to client\nBasis did not warrant us to have an easily\nidentifiable next of Kin to this particular Client. I\nhave made several enquiries to locate any of my\nclient_s relatives immediate and extended, this has\nproved unsuccessful. Hence, I am contacting you. I\nneed you to assist in securing the money and property\nleft behind by my client before they get confiscated\nor declared unserviceable by the Finance House here in\nthe United Kingdom where his deposits were lodged. The\nFinance House has issued Government Mandatory\nFormality, notice to provide the Next of Kin or have\nthe account confiscated within the next one month.\nSince I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his\nrelatives for over two years and convinced that no one\nis coming up and having satisfied the mandatory legal\nrequirement of Beneficiary/next of kin Notification, I\nnow seek a Reliable and Trustworthy person,\nwith your consent and perfect understanding, to\npresent you as the next of kin of the deceased so that\nthe proceeds of this account valued at Twenty One\nMillion, Three Hundred And Twenty Thousand United\nStates Dollars, interest Inclusive, can be paid into\nan account to be provided by you( preferably outside\nthe United Kingdom Financial Institutions or its\nIsles), as the perceived Next Of Kin Legally and\nOtherwise.\nI have all necessary documents to back up these claims\nas Next of Kin on your behalf. All I require is your\nhonest cooperation and confidence in me, which I\nbelieve that it is not easy, as we have not done\nsimilar transaction before and not by reference. Hence\nthe reason I choose to call this a Deal, as it will be\nbased on trust to enable us see this transaction\nthrough. I guarantee that this will be executed under\na legitimate arrangement that will protect you from\nany breach of the law. I would advise that you give\nthis a positive consideration and get back to me soon \nI would be very flexible as well as considerate in\npercentage share that will be given to you for your\nassistance.\nUpon receipt of your response l will send to you my\nprivate number so that you can reach me for further\ndiscussion regarding this project. \nPlease send mail to my private email for security reasons\nwilliam_account_2005@walla.com\nFax: + 44 207 060 1507\nBest regards,\nWilliam Wilcox. \n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1954", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"will.wilcox1@virgin.net\" <will.wilcox1@virgin.net> and our<BR>Business Confidential disposition on Client to client<BR>Basis =", "will.wilcox1@virgin.net <will.wilcox1@virgin.net>"], "dc:format": "multipart/alternative;  of the law.
