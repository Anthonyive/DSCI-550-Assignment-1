For this too you shall also serve as our agent.\r\nIn the light of this, I would like you to forward to me the following information:\r\n1. Your company name and address if any .\r\n2. Your personal fax number.\r\n3. Your personal telephone number for easy communication.\r\n\r\nYou are requested to communicate your acceptance of this proposal through my above stated email address after which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through.\r\nYour quick response will be highly appreciated.\r\nThanks you in anticipation of your cooperation.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nENGGINEER.
