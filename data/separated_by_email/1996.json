In order to avert this negative \ndevelopment, I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your \npermission to have you stand in as next of kin to Our late Customer so \nthat the fund will be released and paid into your account as the \nbeneficiary.s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of \nkin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr.  Morris Thompson.\n\nIn fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in \nthis country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign \naccount and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during \nthe time of transfer since we still work in this bank,this is the actual \nreason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us \nforward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing \nbank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately\nto receive this fund, even an empty a/c can also serve for this purpose.\n\nOn smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as \ngratification for your assisting us, and the remaining 60% will be for me \nand my partners.\n\nWhat I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I \nhave in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully \naccomplish the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk \nfree.\n\nFurther Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your \npositive response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible \nstating your wish. Find in the attachment of my Family Picture, to proof \nwho I am.\n\nI await your Urgent Responce, \n\nRegrads,\n\nMr.Henry Okoye\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-1959", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr Henry Okoye [henryokoye1@pochta.ru]\" <hen_okoye7@myway.com>", "Mr Henry Okoye [henryokoye1@pochta.ru] <hen_okoye7@myway.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"koi8-r\"", "dc:identifier": "<200511161220.jAGCKBUI023484@www4.pochta.ru>", "dc:subject": "Greeting  from henry.", "dc:title": "Greeting  from henry.", "dcterms:created": "2005-11-16T12:20:11Z"}
