WELL, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SCAM LETTERS FROM (GHANA OR OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES, BUT FROM A FAMILY OF WHO ARE IN DISTRESS AND REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE.LET ME START BY INTRODUCING MYSELF PROPERLY TO YOU.\n\n LET ME ATART BY INTRODUCING MYSELF PROPERLY TO YOU, I AM MR. JAMES NGOLA, THE FIRST SON OF BRIDGR. GEN.\nTHEOPHILUS NGOLA (LATE). FORMER CHIEF OF DEFENCE STAFF: NATIONAL REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA. BRIEFLY: MY FATHER, BRIDG. GEN. T. NGOLA BEFORE HIS DEATH DIVERTED THIS FUND (US$25M) TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS. MEANT FOR PURCHASE OF AMMUNATION FOR MY COUNTRY \"LIBERIA\" DURING THE PERIOD OF THEETHNIC CIVIL WAR BETWEEN MY COUNTRY AND GUINEA REPUBLIC. AND NOW, THE WAR IS OVER BY THE INTERVENTION OF \"ECOMOG\"FORCES. \n\n\nFOUR MONTHS AFTER THE WAR ENDED, THE RADIO NATIONAL OF LIBERIA WENT ON AIR, ON A WILD BROADCAST, UNCINGAN UNSUCCESSFUL \"COUPD'TAT\" IN MY COUNTRY, ATTEPTED TO OVERTROW THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN MY COUNTRY HEADED BY \"PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR\". THIS BROADCAST CONTINUED TO ANNOUNCE THE NAMES OF THOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTEMPT. BUT UNKNOWINGLY TO ME, MY FATHER WAS INCLUDED AMOUNG THESE GROUP OF MEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PLOT AS THE \"MASTERMINDER\" AND THE \"FINANCIER\" OF THIS UNDEMOCRATIC ACT. ALTHOUGH HE WAS EXECUTED ALONG SIDE WITH OTHERS. (MAY THEIR SOULS REST IN PERFECT PEACE)\n\nTWO WEEKS AFTER THEIR EXECUTION THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA STIL WENT FURTHER TO PASS JURGEMENT TO CONFISTICATE MY FATHER'S ASSETS AND ALSO TO FREEZE HIS ACCOUNTS. SO WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED ME, I HURRIEDLY GATHERED SOME VALUABLES IN OUR FAMILY VILLA   AND ESCAPED TO (ACCRA), CAPITAL OF GHANA FOR SAFETY, WHILE MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS, SISTERS ARE NOW IN COTE D'IVOIRE AS REFUGEES. THIS FILE, WHICH CONTAINING DOCUMENTS OF A CONSIGNMENT (1 METALIC TRUNK BOX) DEPOSITED BY MY LATE FATHER IN ONE OF THE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES, WAS AMOUNG THE VALUBLE THINGS I ESCAPED WITH TO GHANA. HONESTLY SPEAKING, IN THIS\"BOX\" IS THE SUM OF THIS FUND (US$25 M.) TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY\nDIVERTED BY MY LATE FATHER. HE REGISTERED THIS CONSIGNMENT (BOX) WITH SECURITY COMPANY AS TO CONTAIN (AFRICA ARTS WORK), BUT THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THE DEPOSIT AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY THAT SAYS ONLY HIS FOREIGN PARTNER WILL BE ALLOWED TO COLLECT THE CONSIGNMENT ON HIS BEHALF HENCE HE NEVER WANTED TO BE TRACED WITH THE AMOUNT AS A POPULAR PERSON.\n\n\n\n\nIT IS ON THIS NOTE THAT I AM CONTACTING YOU TO FAITHFULLY AND CONFIDENTIALY ASSIST ME TO \"FRONT\" AS MY LATE FATHER FOREIGN BUSINESS PARTNER IN ORDER TO NECCESITATE AND FACILITATE THE CLAIM OF THIS CONSIGNMENT FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. AND THE FUND ALSO BE TRANSFERED\nINTO YOUR PRIVATE FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENT PERHAPS IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR I CANNOT INVEST HERE DUE TO ITS NEARNESS.\n\nONCE AGAIN, I AM PRESENTLY LIVING IN GHANA ALSO AS A REFUGEE TOO (ASYLUM SEEKER) FOR THE SAKE OF MY LIFE. BE INFORMED, THAT THE FINANCIAL LAW OF GHANA DOES NOT ALLOW A REFUGEE TO OPERATE AN ACCOUNT NOR INCORPORATE A COMPANY. WITH THIS, COUPLED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE MONEY WAS ACQUIRED, AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT IS WHY I DECIDED NOT TO INVEST IN ANYWHERE IN AFRICA OR LIBERIA NOR EVEN GHANA WHERE I AM CURRENTLY RESIDING AS A REFUGEE AND THAT IS WHY I'M SOLICITING FOR YOUR SUPPORT.\n\n\n\n\nIF YOU AGREE TO ASSIST US, I WILL COMPENSATE YOU WITH 15% OF THE TOTAL FUND AFTER THIS CONSIGNMENT IS CLEARED AND THE MONEY TRANSFERED INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT: PROMISE ME TO KEEP THIS TRANSACTION\nCONFIDETIAL & SECRET BECAUSE THIS FUND IS THE ONLY HOPE OF \nMY FAMILY.\n\nFINALLY, CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL AND GET BACK TO ME\nWITH THE E-MAIL ABOVE OR YOU CAN ALSO CALL ME ON THIS NUMBER: 233-27-587908, FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE TRANSACTION AND THE ARRENGMENT ON THE MODALITIES, TO ENSURE QUICK AND SMOOTH TRANSACTION.\n\nFURTHER DETAILS WILL BE FORWARDED TO YOU UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR RESPONSE.\n\nTHANKS AND WISHING THE BEST COOPERATION IN FUTURE.\n\n MR.
