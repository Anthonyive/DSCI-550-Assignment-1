When my late husband \nwas\nalive he deposited the sum of US $3.5M. (Three Million Five \nHundred\nThousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe.\nPresently, this \nmoney is still with the Bank and the management just\nwrote me as the \nbeneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of\nthis money or rather \nissue a letter of authorization to somebody to\nreceive it on my behalf if I \ncan not come over.\nPresently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been \nundergoing\ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to \ntalk\nand my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It \nis\nmy last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations \nany\nwhere in the World.\nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so \nmuch of my wealth since\nmy illness, I cannot live with the agony of \nentrusting this huge\nresponsibility to any of them.\nPlease, I beg you in \nthe name of God to help me Stand\nand collect the Funds from the Bank.\nI \nwant a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund\nchurches, \norphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to\nensure that the \nhouse of God is maintained.\nThe Bible made us to understand that blessed is \nthe hand that giveth.\nI took this decision because I don't have any child \nthat will inherit\nthis money and my husband relatives are not Christians and \nI don't want\nmy husband's hard earned money to be misused by \nunbelievers.\nI don't want a situation where this money will be used in an \nungodly\nmanner.\nHence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not \nafraid of\ndeath hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be \nin\nthe bosom of the Lord.\nExodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my \ncase and I shall hold\nmy peace.\nI don't need any telephone communication \nin this regard\nbecause of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's \nrelatives\naround me always. I don't want them to know about this \ndevelopment.\nWith God all things are possible.\nAs soon as I receive your \nreply I shall give you the contact of\nAttorney who is in Europe as he will be \nthe one to assist you in laying\nclaims for this funds.\nPlease send all \nemails to :mothermrsmelissa1@yahoo.gr\n\u00a0\nYours in \nChrist,\n\u00a0\nMelissa Pointer\n\u00a0\nGod bless \nyou\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2075", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Melissa Pointer\" <mothermelissa11@msn.com>", "Melissa Pointer <mothermelissa11@msn.com>"], "dc:format": "text/html;", "dc:subject": "WITH LOVE IN God bless you in God i trust ,", "dc:title": "WITH LOVE IN God bless you in God i trust ,", "dcterms:created": "2006-01-13T13:57:19Z"}
