On this note, I decided to seek for \nwhom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin as no one has come up as his \nnext of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more \nthan eight years, because the money will be recalled to the bank treasury as \nunclaimed fund after this period. \n\nIn view of this I got your contact through a trade journal when i was making a \nresearch on a foreigner i will use in this great opportunity. For your assistant \nI am willing give you 20% of the total amount. Upon the receipt of your \nresponse, I will send you by fax or e-mail the letter of application which you will\ntype sign and send back to our bank to enable us start this processing of this claim.\n\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you \nshould not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has \nbeen finalized, this transaction will be completed within five banking days of \nrecieving your response, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the \ndeceased. \n\nWhen you receive this mail.
