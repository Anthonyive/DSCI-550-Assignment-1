My \nlate father is\u00a0an aide to exile president Charles Taylor, died as a result \nof uprising against his Government by rebel groups.\n  Meanwhile, before the death of my father he had taken me to Bangkok \nThailand to deposit the sum of\u00a0SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US \nDollars ($7.5million US Dollars) in january 2001 at a Security Company. \nInitially, he intended investing this money in a garment factory in \nBangkok, before the rebel forces assasinated him. This money was deposited \nas Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This \nmoney was part of millions of dollars the president mapped out for the \npurchase of \nammunitions,militaryhard/softwares,light and heavy duty vehicles and \nother defensive logistics. My late father sensing the weakness of the \nruling Government, he took me to\n Thailand in january to deposit the money \nin a private security company as family valuables of containing \ngemstones and financial documents.\n  As he returned from arms negotiation from eastern Europe, he was \nassasinated by the rebels forces on 11 april 2002 which prompted me to seek \nasylum in Thailand where the money and the whole documents are with me \nright now. This resulted to killing and mass action by the government \nand rebel soldiers. Infact, a lot of people have been killed and they are \nstill killing uptill now because of this war of which my father was one \nof the victims.
