This is the story in a nutshell. Now I\nwant an account overseas where the bank will transfer this\nfunds.Thereafter,I had planned to destroy all related documents for this\naccount. It is a careful network and for the past eleven months I have\nworked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation. \n\nThe amount is not so much at the moment and plus all the accumulated\ninterest the balance in this account stands at-(US$14 million US dollars).\n\nNow our questions are:- \n\n1. Can you handle this project? \n\n2. Can I give you this trust? \n\n3. What will be your commission? If you can sponsor this transfer. \n\nConsider this and get back at us as soon as possible. Finally, it is our\nhumble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the\nnecessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. I Expect\nyour urgent response if you can handle this project. \n\nI am expecting your urgent response as soon as you receive my message.\nKindly send any message through my alternative email addresses below for\nsecurity measures thus; laz_amaman@hotmail.com \nRespectfully yours, \nDr Amaman Lazare. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nTargul Online de Joburi .
