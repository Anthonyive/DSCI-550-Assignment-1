MARIAM\r\nABACHA,the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former\r\nMilitary head of state and President of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June\r\n1998. I got your contact through the help of my sister-inlaw that works\r\nwith the Canadian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism,due,I did not disclose\r\nto her my humble intention for a honest foreigner who will help save my\r\nlife and my children. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person by\r\nthe sponsor of the recommendation, I became convinced of your capability\r\nand goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$20 Million secretly\r\nwilled in my favour by the late general (my husband).\r\nThis money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I have\r\nall documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for\r\nsafe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to\r\navoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.We have been deliberating on\r\nhow to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a\r\nconclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for\r\nnon-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian\r\nadministration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the\r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria) is\r\nseeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail\r\nsentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of\r\nthis vendetta,the present Government have resolved to freeze all known\r\nassets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and\r\nare presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband\r\nin Switzerland,UK and Australia. In fact, the attack on our family (The\r\nAbacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling\r\npassport,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in\r\ncourt for offences allegedly committed by my late husband..My first son\r\nMohammed Abacha who was arrested and incacerated for the past 3years was\r\njust reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 Billion to the\r\nFederal Government of Nigeria allegedly stollen by my late Husband.We are\r\nnot ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accounts\r\nabroad have been Freezen by the Obasanjo regime.\r\nIn view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal survival,our\r\nfamily trustee have secretly protected the will,The Security Company has\r\ncalled me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the\r\ndemurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very\r\nsoon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas\r\namount, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come\r\nto my full assistance and unlimited\r\nco-operation.In the meantime,there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole\r\nfamily members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living\r\non goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the\r\nsins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be\r\ntrustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me\r\nand my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will\r\ncompensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of\r\nthe total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.\r\nIn that case, when the money ($20 Million) is moved into your\r\ndiscrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in\r\nyour favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incure\r\n(There are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by\r\nyou.)during the process of securing this fund.\r\nThe remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future.\r\nMy cousin (KADIRI MOHAMMED) has perfected arrangements with the Trust\r\nCompany concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe\r\noperation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance\r\nCompany where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide\r\nowner.\r\nAnd in due course, all contacts must be made through\r\nDR.KADIRI MOHAMMED through his Telephone: 234-8033333606\r\nE-mail address: kadiri_hammed@zwallet.com or kadiri_hammed2@zwallet.com\r\nI look forward to your quick response while thanking\r\nyou for your co-operation. In view of all above\r\ndetails, I request you to keep this letter and\r\nco-operation highly confidential.\r\nBest wishes,\r\nDR.(MRS). MARIAM ABACHA.\r\nABACHAS LODGE,KANO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-210", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"DR (MRS) MARIAM ABACHA\" <koolizzy@hotmail.com>", "DR (MRS) MARIAM ABACHA <koolizzy@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200305092017.h49KHCu10931@truecrime.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "URGENT HELP NEEDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "dc:title": "URGENT HELP NEEDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "dcterms:created": "2003-06-07T04:20:44Z"}
