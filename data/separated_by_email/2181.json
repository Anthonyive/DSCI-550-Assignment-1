My \ninvestigation proved to me that the account has no other beneficiary and \nthat Mr. Howard Sweeney until his death was the manager Sweeney Coy.(pty). \nSA. We will start the first transfer with six million dollars \n[$6,000,000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your \nside, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your \naccount.\n\nThe amount involved is (USD 26M) Twenty six million United States Dollars \nonly. I want to first transfer $6,000.000 [Six million United States Dollar] \nfrom this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I \ndon't know any foreigner.\nI am revealing this to you with believein God that you will never let me \ndown in this business. Also send your private telephone number and fax \nnumber including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.\n\nI need your strong assurance that you will never let me down in this \nbusiness proposition. With my influence and the position of a bank official \nwhom is working in our favour we can transfer this money to any foreigner's \nreliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will \nbe intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.\n\nThe bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we \nreceive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you \ncan come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make \nthis remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at \nleast two days ahead of the money going into the account.\n\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total \namount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might \nhave incurred during the process of transferring.\nI look forward to your earliest response.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nDr Silver Timi.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nLooking for that special gift?
