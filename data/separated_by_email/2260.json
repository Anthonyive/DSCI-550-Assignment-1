Box 238\n\n32 Corn Street\n\nBristol, BS99 7UG\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nEmail:owo_1944@ixp.net\n\n\n\nGood Day,\n\n\n\nI am a staff of NatWest Bank London. I am writing following an\n\noppurtunity in my office that will be of imense benefit to both of us. In my\n\ndepartment we discovered an abandoned sum of \u00a326.5million British Pounds\n\nSterling (Twenty Six million five hundred thousand British Pounds) in an\n\naccount that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris \n\nThompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of\n\nAlaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000,including\n\nhis wife and only daughter. \n\n\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his\n\nnext of kin or relatves to come over and claim his money because we cannot\n\n\u00a0release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to\n\n\u00a0the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only\n\ndaughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the\n\nknowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\n\ndiscovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to\n\nmake business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or\n\n\u00a0beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement\n\n\u00a0since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back\n\ninto Government treasury as unclaimed bill.\n\n\n\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained\n\n\u00a0after five years the money will be transferred into banking treasury as\n\n\u00a0unclaimed funds.\n\n\n\nWe agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign\n\npartner,while the balance will be for me and my colleagues.I will visit your\n\ncountry for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once\n\n\u00a0this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust is\n\nour watchword in this transaction.this transaction is confidential and\n\nrisk free.if you are ready to work with us please forward to me the\n\nrequired information below.\n\n\n\n(1) Send to me immediately A bank account ( a bank account with zero\n\ncredit balance is still ok) \n\n(2) Complete name and address of the Bank \n\n(3) Bank Account Number \n\n(4) Name of Account Holder/Beneficiary \n\n(5) Your address, phone and fax \n\n\n\nOnce you send me the requested information as above, I will initiate\n\nthe processing of the transfer and in about 5 working days the money will\n\nbe in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio.This\n\ntransaction is guaranteed to succeed without any problem. If you agree to\n\nassist me by sending me the above requested information, I will give you\n\nmy complete Details, \n\n\n\nincluding phone/ fax etc and any further clarifications you may require\n\n\u00a0We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response through\n\n\u00a0this email contact:((owo_1944@ixp.net) Have a nice day.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr.Benedict Hills\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMsg sent via eMailWave - http://emailwave.com/ - Get your own FREE account and start receiving your eMail.\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2222", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Dr.Benedict Hills<BR>", "Dr Benedict Hills <owo_1944@ixp.net>"], "dc:format": "text/html; charset=\"iso-8859-1\" akapp@3rc.org, akb@pumas.iingen.unam.mx,", "dc:identifier": "<200602180914.k1I9EGaM018582@mailserver-ng.cs.umbc.edu> ajimenez@catie.ac.cr, ajinkya_aghamkar@rediff.com,", "dc:subject": "Urgent Reply", "dc:title": "Urgent Reply", "dcterms:created": "2006-02-10T21:24:13Z"}
