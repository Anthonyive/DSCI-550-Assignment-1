D\r\nUnion Bank Plc.\r\nLagos \u2013 Nigeria.\r\n\r\nI am the manager of bill and exchange Foreign\r\nOperations Department of Union Bank of Nigeria. I am\r\nwriting following an impressive information about you\r\nthrough one of my friend who runs a consultancy firm.\r\nHe assured of your capability and reliability,\r\nalthough I did not tell him the details of the\r\nbusiness I want to do with you.\r\n\r\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of\r\n$11.5million dollars (Eleven million five hundred\r\nthousand United States Dollars) in an account that\r\nbelongs to one of our foreign customers who died\r\nalong side his entire family on 2002 E.A.S plane crash.\r\n\r\nSince we got information about his death, we have\r\nbeen expecting his relation to come over and claim his\r\nmoney because we cannot release it unless somebody\r\napplies for it as next of kin or relation to the\r\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we learnt that all his immediate family\r\nmembers died along with him at the plane\r\ncrash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund\r\nbehind for the claim since the account is his private\r\naccount. It is therefore upon this discovery that I\r\nand two other officials in this department now decided\r\nto make business with you and release the money to\r\nyou as the next of kin to the deceased for safety\r\nkeeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is\r\ncoming for it and we don\u2019t want this money to go back\r\ninto Federal\r\nGovernment account as unclaimed bill.\r\n\r\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that\r\nsuch money remained after Seven years the money will\r\nbe transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed\r\nfunds and will further be handed over to government.\r\nThe request of a foreigner as next of kin in this\r\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer\r\nwas a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of\r\nkin to a foreigner.\r\n\r\nWe agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as\r\nforeign partner, while the balance will be for my\r\ncolleagues and I. I will visit your country for the\r\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated\r\nabove once this money gets into your account. Please\r\nbe honest to me.\r\n\r\nTherefore to enable the immediate transfer of the\r\nfunds to you as arranged, you must apply first to my\r\nbank as next of kin of the deceased. Upon receipt of\r\nyour response I will send to you a text of the\r\napplication with the name of the deceased and his\r\ncountry and other information about him.\r\n\r\nNote this transaction is confidential and\r\nrisk free. As soon as you receive this mail you\r\nshould contact me through my e-mail address or\r\nalternative email address ahmedmartins10@juno.com\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nAHMED MARTINS.
