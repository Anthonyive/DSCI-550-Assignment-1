I am (ASITA ALI)a senior\r\nstaff in file department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your\r\ncontact from a Yahoo Tourist Search.\r\n\r\nWhen i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of\r\nyour capability\r\nand reliability to champion this businees opportunity when\r\ni prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an\r\nabandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A\r\ndollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who\r\ndied along with his entire family in (friday december 26,2003  ) in a\r\nplane crash.\r\n\r\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next\r\nof kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it\r\nunless\r\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as\r\nindicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all\r\nhis supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane\r\ncrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my\r\ndepartment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release\r\nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety\r\nand subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u2019t\r\nwant this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\r\n\r\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such\r\nmoney remained unclamed after five years, the money will be\r\ntransfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of\r\nforeigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that\r\nthe customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin\r\nto a foreigner.\r\n\r\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in\r\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for\r\nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for\r\n;me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your\r\ncountry for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.\r\n\r\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as\r\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of\r\nthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account\r\nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective\r\ncommunication and location where the money will be remitted.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of\r\nthe application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this\r\ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of\r\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\r\n\r\nYou should contact me on my number 00226 76 52 47 43\r\nimmediately as soon\r\nas you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nYour\u2019s faithfully,\r\nASITA ALI\r\n\r\nPOST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to\r\nenable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove\r\nto the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me\r\nimmediately so that we discuss very well over this business.Please call me\r\nand inform me that you received my mail, because i don't go to net always.\r\n.........................................................................................\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2274", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"asita\" <ali@sunumail.sn>", "asita <ali@sunumail.sn>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=iso-8859-1", "dc:identifier": "<45844.212.52.139.61.1141212866.sunumail@www.sunumail.sn>", "dc:subject": "TREAT AS URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL.", "dc:title": "TREAT AS URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL.", "dcterms:created": "2006-03-01T11:34:26Z"}
