I am (SALIF ZONGO),The Head of file Department in \nAfrican developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.\n\nWhen i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and \nreliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or \nAllah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Twelve \nmillion U.S.Dollars ( 12M Us$) . In an account that belongs to one of our \nforeign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July \n2000) in a plane crash.\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all \nhis supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane \ncrash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \ndiscovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this \nbusinness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or \nrelation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody \nis coming for it and we don\ufffdt want this money to go into the bank treasury \nas unclaimed bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a \nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of \nthis money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision \nof a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the \nbusiness and 60 % would be f or me and my woman colleague. There after i \nwill visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages \nindicated.\n\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, \nyou must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the \nmoney will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax \nor email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice \nthat this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any \natom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.\n\nYou should contact me on my number 00226-7650 9277, immediately as soon as \nyou receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.\n\nYour\ufffds faithfully,\n\nSALIF ZONGO\n\nPOST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to \nmove very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank. As you \nfinish reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well \nover this business.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Messenger: appels gratuits de PC \u00e0 PC ! \nhttp://www.msn.fr/newhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2310", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"salif zongo\" <sliazongo50@hotmail.com>", "salif zongo <sliazongo50@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed", "dc:subject": "TREAT AS URGENT AND CALL ME:+226 7650 9277.", "dc:title": "TREAT AS URGENT AND CALL ME:+226 7650 9277.", "dcterms:created": "2006-03-08T23:57:24Z"}
