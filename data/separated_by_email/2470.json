This is the reason i need someone to work as my representative in the States and\u00a0 asist me in processing the payments made to me by my clients.\n\u00a0\nYou will receive as a weekly salary of 10% of whatever a client pays . Your job will be to receive this payment sent to me which will be sent to you via mail or courier service(if payment is a check,money order or draft) and cashing it at your bank or\n any designated cashing point.\n\u00a0\nIf payment is in through wire transfer, i will require you to open a bank account to receive this payment.\u00a0 I only\u00a0 accept payment from clients that bank with the following banks stated below in America and Canada to make work more convenient for you.\n1. Bank of America\n2. Wells Fargo bank\n3. Citi bank\n4. Royal bank of Canada\n\u00a0\nWhatever the form of payment is you are to immediately deduct your weekly salary(10% of the money) and forward the balance to me\u00a0 as you are instructed to do. Money will be sent to me by WESTERN UNION TRANSFER as this is a safe, secure, fast and reliable means of receiving money.\n  So i would like to know if you would like to work online from home and getting paid weekly without leaving or affecting your present job?If you are interested,please get back to me as soon as possible.\n  \nTo get started all i require from you is your full name, address\n and phone number so that i can email you a letter of employment from my company which you have to reply with a signed acceptance letter and a scanned copy of your Identification card or International Passsport attached to it.\n\u00a0\nI anxiously await your response.\n  Your Faithfully, \nEmmanuel davids\nManager Emmanueldavids ArtWorld\n  \nN/B: TO SAFEGUARD THE INTEREST OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES(YOU) I ONLY ACCEPT CERTIFIED AND NOTABLE BANK CHEQUES FROM MY CLIENTS.
