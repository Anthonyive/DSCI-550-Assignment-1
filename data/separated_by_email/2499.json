Now, we are left with the balance of $28.6M as the over invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated for our own use.

Note that the following information:  your private phone number and email address willenable us seek/secure approval of the fund from the concerned government quarters/ministries within 3-4 banking days.As soon as we confirm receipt of this money in your nominated bank account, my partner and I will come over to your country to arrange for our own share and possibly invest part of this  money in your country.
