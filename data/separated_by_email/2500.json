Though I am very rich, I was never \ngenerous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business \nas that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now \nknow that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money \nin the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this \nworld I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now \nthat God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and \nassets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close \nfriends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have \ndecided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of \nthe last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to \nsomecharity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia. \n\nNow that my healthhas deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked \nmembers of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money \nwhich I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they \nrefused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them \nanymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. \nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of \nTwenty Eight Million dollars($28,000,000,00) that I have with a \nfinance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this \ndeposit and despatch it to charity organizations. \n\nN/B:KINDLY NOTE THAT 60% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims,35% \nshould go to the victims of huricane in the United Statea of America and \nanother 5% for your effort and time. \nPlease note that all correspondence as regards this project should be \ndirected to my private mail box. \nEmail:martinmccourt1@msn.com \n\nI await your prompt response. \n\nThanks, \nMartin Mccourt. \n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2462", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Martin Mccourt\" <martinmccourt2@msn.com>", "Martin Mccourt <martinmccourt2@msn.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;", "dc:identifier": "<BZ7HVm9h$86.135.88.194$.444ceb43.d2d34.5e17.3858@titanium.onspeed.com>", "dc:subject": "from martin", "dc:title": "from martin", "dcterms:created": "2006-04-24T15:14:12Z"}
