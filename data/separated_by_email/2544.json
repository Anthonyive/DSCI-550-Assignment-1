I am an \neconomist by profession. My \nhusband was just caught in\nNigeria, but matters \nwere not helped when \nUN Special War Crimes\n Court for Sierra Leone indicted my husband for \nwar\ncrimes , demanding his prosecution.  \nI am awaiting the\noutcome of \nevents in my \ncountry, and what will become of me and my husband in\nasylum. The reason\n is this. During the political crisis some years ago\nin Sierra Leone (West\n African Country rich in diamonds), my husband \nwas\nactively involved.\nEarly this year, he entrusted some large \nquantities of\ndiamonds to me. \nFearing its detection due to the volume, \nmy\nson (Williams) \ntraveled to Dublin,Ireland with the diamonds (on my\ninstructions) and sold them,\n getting a total of US$28,000,000.00 \n(Twenty Eight \nmillion US Dollars \nonly). This money he moved into a \nsafe Finance House\nfor protective \ncustody under a different name.\nNow, \nthe  government of Dublin,Ireland has refused issuing\nneither him nor \nmy \nfamily any visa to travel to their country again\nbecause of the \ncurrent \npolitical situation. This is why I need you to please\n to  \nclaim this money and subsequently deposit\nsame in a reputable\n bank \nthere for onward transfer to your account, or to\ninstruct the safe\n \nhouse to move the funds out of there  to any of their\ncorresponding \nbanks or offices in London or Europe for onward\ntransfer to your \naccount.\nI am also willing to forfeit any percentage you want.\n My only \ndaughter Helen died in October 1999 from\ncomplications of \npneumonia. \nPlease note that my husband is not even\naware that I sold the\n \ndiamonds, \nIf you cannot help us, simply destroy and forget I\never \ncontacted you. \n  \nMay God guide you in whatever you decide, and thank\nyou for taking out \ntime to read this request.\nFondest regards.\n\nMrs. \nJewel Howard Taylor\n\n======================\n \n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2506", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Madam Jewel Taylor <madamjewel22@virgilio.it> getting a total of US$28,000,000.00", "Madam Jewel Taylor <madamjewel22@virgilio.it>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=\"UTF-8\" My only", "dc:subject": "4th May 2006", "dc:title": "4th May 2006", "dcterms:created": "2006-05-04T13:18:08Z"}
