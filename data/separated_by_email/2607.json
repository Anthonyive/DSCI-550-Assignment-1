We were married for eleven years without a child.\n\n\nHe died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his\n\ndeath we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to\n\nremarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which !\n the Bible is against.\n\nWhen my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $1.6Million (One\n\nMillion six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) in a Security company here in Cote D'Ivoire Abidjan.\n\n\nPresently,this money is still at the Security company were he made the deposited of the fund onto my name as the next of kin. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.\n\n\nHaving known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church that\n\nwill utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a\n\nchurch that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word\n\nof God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that? Blessed is the hand that giveth?.\n\n\nI took this decision because I don?t have any child that will inherit this money and my plenty of r!\n elatives are not Christians and I don't want my our efforts to be used\n by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way.\n\n\nThis is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I\n\nknow where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the\n\nLord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that, the lord will fight my case and I shall\n\nhold my peace. I don't need any telephone\n\ncommunication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of\n\nmy husband?s relatives around me always.\n\nI dont want them to know about this development.
