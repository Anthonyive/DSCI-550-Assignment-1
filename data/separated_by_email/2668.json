Kim Changho made a numbered time\n\n(fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued\n\nat ?5,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling)\n\nin my Bank upon maturity. I sent a rountine\n\nnotification to his forwarding address but got no\n\nreply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally\n\nwe discovered from one of their staff in The submit\n\noil company that Engr. Kim Changho is among the\n\npassengers that perished in a plane crash [Korean\n\nAir Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on\n\nAugust 6, 1997. Since the demise of this our\n\ncustomer..\n\n\nOn further investigation, i found out that he died\n\nwithout making a  WILL, and attempts to trace his next of kin was\n\nfruitless.I therefore made further investigation and\n\ndiscovered that Engr. Kim Changho did not declare\n\nany next of kin or relations in all his official\n\ndocuments, including his Bank deposit paperwork in\n\nmy Bank. This sum of ?5,000,000.00 is still in my\n\nbank and the interest is being rolled over with the\n\nprincipal sum at the end\n of each year. No one will\n\never come forward to claim it.According to the\n\nBritish law, at the expiration of (10)years, the\n\nmoney will revert to the ownership of the British\n\nGovernment if nobody applies to claim the fund\n\nConsequently, my proposal is that i will like you as\n\na foreigner to stand as the next of kin to late\n\nEngr. Kim Changho, So that the fruit of this old\n\nman's labour will not get into the hands of some\n\ncorrupt Government officials.\n\n\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide\n\nimmediately your full name and address so that the\n\nAttorney will prepare the necessary documents and\n\naffidavits which will put you in place as the next\n\nof kin.
