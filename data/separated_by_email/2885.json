I got your name and\u00a0 contact from the internet when i was searching for a\u00a0 reliable and trustworthy person and I prayed over it and\u00a0 selected your name among other names due to its esteeming\u00a0 nature and the recommendations given to me as a reputable\u00a0 and trust worthy person that can help me out of this\u00a0 dificulties and by the recommendation , I must not\u00a0 hesitate to confide in you for this simple and sincere\u00a0 help .\n\n\n\n\nI am Miss Sonia Obudu the only child of late Mr.and\u00a0 Mrs. Johnson Obudu . My father was a very wealthy cocoa\u00a0 merchant in Abidjan , the economic capital of Ivory\u00a0 coast, my father was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outings on a business trip .\n\n\n\n\nMy mother died when I was a baby and since then my father\u00a0 took me so special. Before the death of my father on\u00a0 12 febuary 2003 in a private hospital here in Abidjan he\u00a0 secretly called me on his bed side and told me that he has\u00a0 the sum of seventeen million ,seven hundred thousand United State\u00a0 Dollars.USD($17.700,000) left in a suspense account in one of the prime bank here in Abidjan ,that he used my name\u00a0 as his only child for the next of Kin in depositing of\u00a0 the fund. He also explained to me that it was because of\u00a0 this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates. That I should seek for a foreign partner in a\u00a0 country of my choice where i will transfer this money and\u00a0 use it for investment purpose such as Real Estate managment. \n\n\n\n\nI am just 22years old and a university undergraduate.I\u00a0 have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of members of\u00a0 my late father's family who has not stop\u00a0 disturbing me about the where about of this fund after they have succeded in claiming almost all the valuable\u00a0 properties that he left behind for me, coupled with\u00a0 incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.\n\n\n\n\nPlease, I am honourably seeking your assistance in\u00a0 thefollowing ways:\n\n(1) To provide a bank account into which this money would be\u00a0 transferred to .\n\n(2) To serve as a guardian of this fund since I am only 22 years.\n\n(3) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country\u00a0 to further my education and to secure a resident permit in\u00a0 your country.\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, I am willing to offer you 10% of the total\u00a0 sum as compensation for your effort/input after the\u00a0 successful transfer of this fund into your nominated\u00a0 account overseas.\n\nAnticipating to hear from you soon.\n\n\n\n\nThanks and God bless.\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\n\nMiss Sonia Obudu\n\nPlease Reply To This Email\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sonia_2006_obudu@yahoo.ca\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2847", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["<sonia_obudu@centrum.cz> .
