When the box arrives, you will meet the diplomatic officials and they will assist you. All the documents covering the legality of the money will be sending to you through my lawyer name \nBarrister kwame Kofi. \n  \nAs you can understand, presently we are in very tight situation and hence I have not been able to pay the demurrage that the box has accumulated that is the reasons we have not remove the boxes from the company. Every day, which the boxes spend in the company for safe keeping, it accumulates demurrage of $20 per day. This is why I work out this strategy to take this box out of Africa. There, you will help me receive it as our trustee or beneficiary. \n  \nI and my brother have worked out %20 of the amount for you and your family,%10 kept aside for all expenses\u00a0 and the remaining %70 is what I\n and my family will invest and live with. \n  \nI know you will be wondering how I got your contact.I came cccros your contact while searching for a reliable, trustworty person to handle this progect.I will be very grateful if only you can help me out of this transaction, Because I want this cash to be moved out of Ghana to overseas for investment under your care without any further delay.mail to my private email\u00a0 kamokai2006@latinmail.com.
