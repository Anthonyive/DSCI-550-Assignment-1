As you\nread the mail, you should sympathize with my current situation and assist\nme. My name is Isabella Carmel the only survivor from family of four. I was\nnarrowly escaped from the tsunami disaster which affected my spinal cord and\nalso my ear drum and claim the lifes of my entire family, husband (Denis\ncaromel) and two sons (Ugo and Tom) who went for holidays in\nSri-Lanka.\n\n\nRight now I am currently in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.\nAfter staying a week in my family hospital, I was disabled by the\ncatastrophe and now on a wheel cheer after all the treatment.This has\ndefiled all forms of medicine and right now I have only about a few months\nto live, according to medical experts.I have not lived my life so well as my\nprimary interest and focus was only on my late fathers business. Though my\nfather is very rich and was never generous. But now I regret all this, as I\nknow that there is more in life than just wanting to have or make all the\nmoney in the world.The bible says what shall it profit a man to wine the\nwhole world and loose his soul. I believe when God gives me a second chance\nto come to this world I will live my life a different way from how I have\nlived before. I have willed and given most of my fathers properties to the\nless privileges because I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.\nI have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and\ncomfort to the less privileged in our societies. I want this to be one of\nthe last good deeds I do on earth since my father has never recognized\nthat.\n\n\nSo far I have to distribute money to charity organizations\nnow that my health has deteriorated so badly,I cannot do this myself anymore\nthat is why am soliciting your assistant to make this donation through you.\nThe last of my late fathers money that am willing to donate to the less\nprivileged right now is the huge sum of $10.6M USD that is concealed in a\nconsignment and deposited in (OVERSEA CREDIT COMMISSION ABROAD) for\nsafekeeping which he intends to invest on profitable factory. \n\n\nI\nwant you to help me claim this funds where is deposited and disburse it to\ncharity organizations and the less privileged in the society.Please I will\nappreciate you to indicate interest for the disbursement and also include\nyour contact telephone/fax numbers that I will forward to the(OVERSEA CREDIT\nCOMMISSION ABROAD) to be able to contact you as the appointed beneficiary. I\nwill provide you the certificate of deposit and the letter of authority to\nenable you claim the consignment of the funds.\n\nIf you are willing and\nready to assist with this project,please e-mail me at\nmrslsabellacaromel_1950@yahoo.it without delay, while I wait to hear from\nyou.Thanks once again for your kindness may God guide and reward you in all\nyour endeavors as you make me realize my last dreams and\nwishes.\n\n\n\nRemain blessed,\nMrs.Isabella Caromel\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\nCristina\nFusi WebMail - Message sent using UebiMiau 2.7.2\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2951", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "2", "dc:creator": ["\"Mrs.Isabella Caromel\" <mrslsabellacaromel_1950@yahoo.it>", "Mrs.Isabella Caromel <mrslsabellacaromel_1950@yahoo.it>"], "dc:format": "text/html; charset=\"iso-8859-1\";", "dc:identifier": "<200608240909.k7O99BM9013675@awakenings.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "USE FOR THE LESS PRIVILEGED?", "dc:title": "USE FOR THE LESS PRIVILEGED?", "dcterms:created": "2006-08-24T09:09:01Z"}
