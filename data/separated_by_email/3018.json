GULLY GRACI ATTN:\r\nDEAR\r\nI AM THE MANAGER OF BILLS AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN\r\nREMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF THE ECOBANK SPAIN PLC. I AM\r\nWRITING THIS LETTER TO ASK FOR SUPPORT AND CO-OPERATION\r\nTO CARRY OUT THIS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN MY\r\nDEPARTMENT.

SINCE WE GOT\r\nINFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTIN G HIS\r\nNEXT OF KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE\r\nCANNOT RELEASE THE MONEY UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIES FOR IT\r\nAS THE NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS\r\nINDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES.

THE NEED FOR A FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN\r\nIN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASSIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE\r\nCUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A SPAINISH CANNOT STAND AS\r\nHIS NEXT OF KIN OR HEIR. WE AGREED THAT 30% OF THE M o\r\nnEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS FOREIGN PARTNER, THERE AFTER MY\r\nCOLLEAGUE AND I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR\r\nDISBURSEMENT ACCORDING TO THE PERCENTAGE INDICATED.\r\nTHEREFORE, TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUND\r\nTO YOU AS INDICATED. YOU MUST APPLY TO THE BAN K AS A\r\nRELATION OR NEXT OF KIN OF THE DECEASED, INDICATING\r\nYOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER AND LOCATION WHEREIN THE MONEY\r\nWILL BE REMITTED.
