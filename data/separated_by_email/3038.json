It is\ntherefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you and release themoney to you as the next of kin or \nrelation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement \nsincenobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into \nthe bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking and financial law and \nguide line here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed \nafterSEVEN years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury \nas unclaimed fund. The request offoreigner as next of kin in this \nbusiness is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a national here cannot stand as next ofkin to a foreigner.\n\nI agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a respect to the \nprovision of a foriegn account ,10%will be set aside for expenses \nincurred during the business and 50% would be for me Thereafter, I \nwillvisit your country for disbursement according to the percentage \nindicated Therefore, to enable theimmediate transfer of this fund to \nyour country ,you must apply first to our security firm here in London \nbecause of financial laws guiding this country,we have moved the money \nin question to our Security Company Vault here in London for easy \ntransfer of this fund to any where in the world.So i will like you to \nsend tome your NAME,TELEPHONE NUMBER and PHYSICAL ADDRESS for easy and \neffective communication and location where in\nthe money is bound to.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will get back to you on the next moves \nto make. I will not fail to bring to your notice that thistransaction \nis hitch-free and that you should notentertain any atom of fear as all \nrequiredarrangements have been made for the transfer. You should \ncontact me immediately as soon as you receive\nthis letter.\n\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\nYours Faithfully,\nMR.CHRIS BARTHOLET.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-2999", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"chrisbartholet092@adinet.com.uy\" <chrisbartholet092@adinet.com.uy>", "chrisbartholet092@adinet.com.uy <chrisbartholet092@adinet.com.uy>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=\"ISO-8859-15\"", "dc:identifier": "<33237519.1157499926430.JavaMail.tomcat@fe-ps02>", "dc:subject": "CAN WE HANDLE THIS TOGETHER?", "dc:title": "CAN WE HANDLE THIS TOGETHER?", "dcterms:created": "2006-09-05T23:45:26Z"}
