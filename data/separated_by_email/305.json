This money is kept with private security company in Europe since two years ago. It is only my son and myself that know where the money is kept and has the documents for it.\r\n\r\nDue to the current situation in the country concerning government\u2019s vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer the ownership of this fund to you so that you can asisst us to claim it and used for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband. My family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation\r\nof public funds during his regime.\r\n\r\nTowards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying out financial transactions without their express permission is in force.

The money personally belongs to my husband and he intended that it still be used for investment.
