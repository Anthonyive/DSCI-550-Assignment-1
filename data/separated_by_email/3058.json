I am Mrs Kathy\nOlds,wife of Late Mr Martin Olds,a famous\nzimbabwean\ntobacco/cattle farmer who was murdered in a farmland\ndispute in\nZimbabwe.Please gothrough: \n\n\nhttp://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html\n\n\n\nI got yourcontact through a search on the internet\nhere in South Africa. I\ndo not know your person but I\nam relying on faith to see me through. During\nthe war\nwaged against the farmers in Zimbabwe by the\nsupporters and\ncohorts of President Robert Mugabe to\nclaim all the white owned farms in our\ncountry, my\nlate husband belonged to one of the classes of farmers\nalso\ntargeted by the ZANU-PF armed group,because he\ndid not support theirideas and\npolicies of taking\nwhite farmers \nland by force. \n\n\n\nBlackwar veterans claiming tobe farmers, invaded my\nhusband's house on\nApril 17, 2000 at about 8.35pm in\nMacheke/Virginia district and murdered him\nbecause of\nhis insistence that white farmers be allowed to retain\ntheir\nfarmlands despite the\u00a0 recently introduced land\nreforms\"Act\" in Zimbabwe\nby \nthe head of state,President Robert Mugabe. \n\n\nUntil his death he was one of the prominent members of\nthe Zimbabwean\nFarmers'Union (ZFU)But before my\nhusbands death, he first escaped safely\ninto\nneighbouring South Africa with his life time fortune\nof\nUS$37m(Thirty-seven Million \nUSdollars)cash, important documents of property\ntitle\nand other \nvaluables which were concealed and secured in a\ntrunk\nbox, and \ntransported to Johannesburg through diplomatic means. \n\n\nThe consignment box is currently safely lodged and\nsecured in the vaults\nof a private security firm here\nin Johannesburg after which he returned to\nzimbabwe\nwhile he was killed. The fund was meant for the\npurchase of new\ntractors,machinery and agro-allied\nchemicals for our new farms acquired in\nSwaziland. \n\n\nThis land problem came when President\u00a0 Robert Mugabe\nintroduced a new\nland act\"ModusOperandi\" reform which\nwholly affected the rich white farmers.\nA lot of\npeople were killed because of this land reforms \"Act\"\nof which my\nlate husband was one of the main\ntargets.Based on this,I had to flee the\ncountry with\nmy \ntwo children and my only late husband\npersonal\nassistance [PA] Mr Chris Mutembi who was his\npersonal\nassistant{PA}. \nWe are now in south africa as political\nassylum\nseekers/refugees. \n\n\nWe decided to contact you to assist us in removing\nthis money my husband\nkept in a private security\ncompany here in south africa to your account or\nany\npart of the world for investments as the\nmonetary/investment laws here\nin south africa\nprohibits refugees and illegal immigrants from\noperating\nbank accounts or be involved in any\ntransaction/investment. Based on this,\n\nwe are contacting you hoping that you will assist us\nwith this\ntransaction. \n\n\nAs a widow, I am saddled with the responsibility of\nseeking a genuine and\nan honest person who will assist\nus in investing this money in a highly\nprofit yeilding\nventures without the knowledge of\nmy\ncountry(Zimbabwe)government who are bent on taking\neverything my late\nhusband \nhad after confiscating all his farmlands and\ninvestments in\nZimbabwe \n. \n\n\nWe are absolutely left with nothing except the money\nhe deposited in a\nprivate security company here in\nsouth africa.
