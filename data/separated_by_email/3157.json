I will first introduce myself as Mr. Amos \r\nTower, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known bank, \r\nhere in London, England.\r\n\r\nOne of our accounts, with holding balance of  \r\n\u00a315,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last \r\noperated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation, the \r\nowner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on \r\nthe 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham; you can view \r\nthis CNN website \r\n\r\nhttp://edition.cnn. \r\ncom/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/  for details on the crash.\r\n\r\nSince then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this \r\nmoney, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the \r\nexistence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from \r\nthe National Immigration also states that he was\r\nsingle on entry into \r\nthe UK.\r\n\r\nI have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank \r\nofficials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal \r\nwith. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the \r\nnext of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you \r\nafter necessary processes have been followed.\r\n\r\nThis transaction is \r\ntotally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does \r\nnot originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal \r\nact.\r\n\r\nOn your interest, let me hear from you.\r\n\r\nWarm Regards,\r\n\r\nMr. Amos \r\nTower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3116", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr. Amos Tower\" <amos_tower2@virgilio.it>", "Mr. Amos Tower <amos_tower2@virgilio.it>"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=\"UTF-8\"", "dc:subject": "From Mr. Tower", "dc:title": "From Mr. Tower", "dcterms:created": "2006-10-06T03:31:14Z"}
