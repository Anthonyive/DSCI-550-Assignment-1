In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$39.5m dollars \n(thirty-nine million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that \nbelongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, \nGermany) who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane \ncrash. for more information about the crash you can visit this site:( \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm)\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \ndiscovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and \nrelease the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for \nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we \ndon't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\n\nThe banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after eight years, the money will be transferred into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision \nof a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during \nthe business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country \nfor disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable \nthe immediate transfer of this fund to your arranged, you must apply first \nto the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of \napplication form that I will send to you when I hear from you, so I will \nlike you to send to me your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where the money will be remitted.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is \nhitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all \nrequired arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me \nimmediately as soon as you receive this letter.\n\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\nThe manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of \nBANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A).\n\nBest Regard\nMr Harrison Compaore.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Hotmail sur i-mode\ufffd : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre \nt\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable ! http://www.msn.fr/hotmailimode/\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3159", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"harrison compaore\" <harricom0359@hotmail.com>", "harrison compaore <harricom0359@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed", "dc:identifier": "<BAY23-F144DBF1A57AFC915EC3846C10E0@phx.gbl>", "dc:subject": "URGENT RESPONSE NEEDED ", "dc:title": "URGENT RESPONSE NEEDED ", "dcterms:created": "2006-10-17T13:50:35Z"}
