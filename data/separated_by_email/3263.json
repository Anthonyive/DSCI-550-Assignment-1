My name \nis Dr.Mark Kingsley William, and I work in the International Operation \nDepartment in a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you \nin this important business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been \ngreatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still \nremains the fastest medium of communication.

Of ( THIRTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED \nAND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ) on further discreet investigation, I also \ndiscovered that the account holder has  passed away (dead) leaving no \nbeneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any \nforeigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am \ncertainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. \nA foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account \nHolder, therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction.
