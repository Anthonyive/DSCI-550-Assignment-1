This is the\nreason why it will require  a second party or fellow  who  will forward\nclaims  as the next of kin to the bank  and  also present  a foriegn\naccount\n\nwhere he will need the money  to be  retransferred into  on his request\nas it may be after due verification and clarification by the\ncorrespondent branch  of the bank where the  money will be remitted from to \nyour own\ndesignation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this \ntransaction  is 100%    risk\nfree.On smooth conclusion of this  transaction;you will be entitled  to \n30%of\nthe total  sum as gratification;while5% will be set aside to take care of\nexpenses that may arise during the time of  transfer   and also telephone\nbills; while65%will be for me.Please;you have been adviced to keep  top\nsecret as i am still in service and intend to retire  from service\nafter we conclude  this deal with you.\n\nI will be monitoring  the whole  situation here in this bank  until you\nconfirm the money  in your account  and ask  me to come  down to your\ncountry  for subsequent sharing of the fund according  to  percentages\npreviously  indicated and further investment,either in  your country or\nany country  you advice us to invest.All other necessary vital  information\nwill be sent to  you when i hear from you.\n\nI  look forward to  receive your email .\nYours  faithfully\nYUSUF ALI.\n\n                     Please mail me with this adress  \nEmail;yusuf_ali778@yahoo.fr\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWindows Live Spaces : cr\u00e9ez votre Space \u00e0 votre image ! \nhttp://www.windowslivespaces.fr/\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3275", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"yusuf ali\" <yusuf_ali92b@hotmail.fr>", "yusuf ali <yusuf_ali92b@hotmail.fr>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed", "dc:identifier": "<BAY119-F19BE557544DB34216FF1C084E80@phx.gbl>", "dc:subject": "TREAT AS URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL.", "dc:title": "TREAT AS URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL.", "dcterms:created": "2006-11-17T15:50:22Z"}
