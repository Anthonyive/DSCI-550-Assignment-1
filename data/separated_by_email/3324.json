I am Mr. Dezaryi,\nthe personal \naccount officer to the great late\ndiseased who has an account in one of \nthe top banks\nhere in South Africa. The account was opened in 2001\nand \nhe died in 2004 without a written or oral WILL and\nsince 2004 nobody \nhas operated on this account again\nhence the money is floating and if I \ndo not remit this\nmoney out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing\nand Govt. of South Africa will confiscate the funds\nfor their personal \nuse which I personally don't want\nsuch incident to happen being that \nthis is a great\nopportunity for me. \n \nMy contact is for you to please \nassist me to transfer\nthe fund ($172,654,000.00 USD) One Hundred & \nSeventy\nTwo Million Six Hundred And Fifty Four Thousand United\nState \nDollars from a Cooperate Bank here in South\nAfrica to an oversea \naccount. First, I must solicit\nyour strictest confidence in this \ntransaction. This is\nby virtue of its nature as being utterly \nconfidential.\nI am sure and have confidence of your ability and\nreliability to prosecute a transaction of this great\nmagnitude. I \nsolicit your assistance to enable us\ntransfer the said amount into your \nsafe account for\nonward investment.\n \nYou can either provide us with an \nexisting account or\nto set up a new Bank account immediately to receive\nthis money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive\nthis money, as long \nas you will remain honest to me\ntill the end of this important business \ntrusting in\nyou and believing that you will never let me down\neither \nnow or in future because this business is my\nlife. The owner of this \naccount is a foreigner and no\nother person knows about this account or \nanything\nconcerning it, the account has no other beneficiary\nand until \nhis death he was the manager of the company.\nMy investigation through \nthe National immigration\ndepartment & Ministries here proved to me as \nwell that\nhe was single as at the time of his entry into the\nRepublic \nof South Africa. The amount in this account\nis USD ($172,654,000.00 \nUSD) Two Hundred & Twenty\nfifty million United States Dollars} only.\n \nAs a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this\nfund abroad for \ninvestment. Your assistance as a\nforeigner is necessary because the \nmanagement of the\nbank will welcome any foreigner who has correct\ninformation to this account which I will give to you\nimmediately, if \nyou are interested to do this business\nwith me. There is no risk in \nthis business. With my\nposition and my personal contact with the \nmanager of\nthe bank, the money can be transferred to any account\nyou \ncan provide with assurance that this money will be\nintact pending our \nphysical arrival in your country\nfor sharing.  We will start the first \ntransfer with\nFifty million [$50,000.000]. Upon successful transfer\nwithout any disappointment from your side, we shall\nre-apply for the \npayment of the remaining balance of\n$122,654,000.00 Million to your \naccount. I am only\ncontacting you as a foreigner because this money\ncannot be approved to a local person here, but can\nonly be approved to \nany foreigner who has the correct\ninformation of the account, which I \nwill provide for\nyou. So you should provide me with your correct\naccount details where you will like the fund to be\ntransferred to, or \nyou can set up a new account for\nthe transfer even an empty account is \nok. At the\nconclusion of the transfer you will take 45%, 6% will\nbe for \nany expenses both parties incurred in the\nprocess of this business and \nthe remaining 49% will be\nfor me. As soon as I hear from you and upon \nyour\nstrong assurance that you will not let me down once\nthe fund goes \ninto your account I will then start the\nprocessing of the transfer of \nthe fund to your account\nwithout further delay.
