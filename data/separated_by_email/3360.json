A Citizen of Zimbabwe,I am now seeking\r\npolitical assylum. I got your contact through the\r\nInformation Exchange Online.\r\n\r\nI am the only Son of Sonya Michael, a wealthy black\r\nfarmer and senior politician with the opposition\r\npolitical party in my country, Movement for Democratic\r\nChange (MDC). Our wicked President Robert Mugabe\r\nmurdered my father, before I ran way from my country\r\nbecause I have become his next target to eliminate. My\r\nfather was a fighter for Justice and a moving force in\r\nThe MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of\r\nbrutal Dictatorship government of President Robert\r\nMugabe. You will read more stories about President\r\nMugabe's brutal acts by visiting this web\r\nsite:<http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html>\r\n\r\nMy father was accused of assisting the White farmers\r\nin fighting the government. Few weeks after his\r\narrest, he was reported dead. The government claimed\r\nhe died of heart attack and his body was never seen\r\nfor proper autopsy, they buried him in the government\r\ncemetery. My father's associate Mr.Mc Graw Olds a\r\nWhite farmer from Britain assisted me in fighting my\r\nfather's death through the Court and media.\r\n\r\nThe Government saw us as a big threat to them and\r\ndecided to eliminate us. Mr. Olds was attacked and\r\nmurdered in his House, but fortunately, before they\r\ncame looking for me, I received the news and I left\r\nthe country through the border to save my life.\r\n\r\nHere is my reason for contacting you. Before the death\r\nof my father, he deposited (US$ 7,000,000.00) with a finance firm,The\r\nmoney was deposited as a gem/precious stone in a metal\r\ntrunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the\r\nsecurity company organization. This money was\r\nearmarked for the purchase of new machinery and\r\nchemicals for the farms and the establishment of new\r\nfarms in Lesotho and Swaziland.\r\n\r\nThe government seized my father\u2019s farms and bank\r\naccount before his arrest and Murder. He told me\r\neverything concerning the funds while he was still in\r\ndetention. This is why I need your assistance in\r\nsecuring the funds there in your Country, so that I\r\ncan arrange on how to come over to your country for\r\nthe investment of the fund, I am willing to offer you\r\n25% of the total fund for your assistance.as you may\r\nknow that the financial law and regulations of the\r\ngovernment does not give we assylum seekers financial\r\nrights to such huge sum of money. In view of this, The\r\nmonetary policy/law does not allow such investment by\r\nan asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if\r\nyou can assist me, so that I can give you more details\r\non how we shall proceed.\r\n\r\nAs I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this\r\ninformation as top secret.Pls u can also contact me through this alternative\r\nmail (mr_sajoy01@voila.fr)\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nMr.Ajoy Sonya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3313", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Mr.Ajoy Sonya.\" <mr.sajoy1@yahoo.it>", "Mr.Ajoy Sonya. <mr.sajoy1@yahoo.it>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<truJSZA7Uq$213.154.93.116$.456e0dfd.c3da8.2afb.11768@lithium.onspeed.com>", "dc:subject": "Mr.Ajoy Sonya.", "dc:title": "Mr.Ajoy Sonya.", "dcterms:created": "2006-11-29T21:47:30Z"}
