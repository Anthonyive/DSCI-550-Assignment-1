This fund was deposited since 2000 by the deacesed and since\r\n2002 nobody has operated the said account. After going through some old files in the records, I\r\ndiscovered that the owner of this dormant account Mr.Andreas B. Simth does no longer exist and that if\r\nI do not remit this fund out urgently, it would be forfeited for nothing.\r\n\r\nI am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account and foreign\r\nbeneficiary.
