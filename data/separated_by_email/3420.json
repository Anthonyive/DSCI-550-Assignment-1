According to Laws of the\u00a0 bank, at the expiration of 5 (five)\nyears, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government\nif nobody applies to claim the fund.\n\n\u00a0Consequently, i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the \nnext of kin . I need your full name and address \nfor\u00a0 the attorney to prepare the necessary documents and affidavits \nthat will put you in place as the next of kin. The money will be paid \ninto your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% \nfor you.\n\u00a0\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my personal email: \n\u00a0\nmrsscholess@yahoo.co.uk\n\u00a0\nPhone number +44-703-194-2033\n\nThanks and regards,\n\nMrs Catherine Schole. \n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Visit MSN Holiday Challenge for your chance to win up to $50,000 in Holiday cash from MSN today! \n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3373", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"catherine schole\" <carthyschole_uk21@hotmail.com>", "catherine schole <carthyschole_uk21@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/html; format=flowed", "dc:identifier": "<BAY12-F68F71F7AA18B9A36BAF6886CB0@phx.gbl>", "dc:subject": "THANKS", "dc:title": "THANKS", "dcterms:created": "2006-12-16T04:13:33Z"}
