The money is an over-invoiced contract amount executed by a foreign supplier and commissioned with African Millennium Villages project (AMVP), and the original supplier has been paid since march last year remaining the over-invoiced amount of $8million. This was intentional and since then the US$8million has been in the suspense account of our organization awaiting for claim. Now i am ready to transfer the fund(US$8million) overseas for our personal business investment and that is where i need your assistance by providing me with a trusted bank account to remit the fund. Then both of us will share the fund.\r\n \r\nNow, how to start is just for me to pass through my attorney and register your name/company as a sub-contract with African Millennium Villages project, and the date of the registration will be back-dated to the date the contract was awarded to the original supplier. Then you will serve among the foreign suppliers that supplied relief material to our organization awaiting for payment.\r\n \r\nAll arrangements have been put in place to ensure a successful project. Please if you are capable of working this project with me get back to me quickly via thisemail:[mrammer2006@yahoo.ca] We will discuss on the sharing modality of the fund if i receive your positive response. I will send you more details on how we are going to proceed on the claim. Note this project is risk free and genue.With your corporation it will only take just few weeks to accomplish our project.\r\n \r\nKind regards\r\n \r\nMr.David Ammer \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3375", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["mr david ammer <mrammer2006@yahoo.ca> year remaining the over-invoiced amount of $8million.
