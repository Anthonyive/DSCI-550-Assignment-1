My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found you and perhaps trustworthy to give you this priority of shipping the trunk box to any address that you think is very secure and save in your country for onward lodgement in your account for the purpose of future investment with your percentage of which we shall talk of it. I will send you the Authorization Certificate to call them in my next mail which is the Certificate of deposit that they gave me on the very day when the box of money was deposited under their security company. I give thanks immensely for your co-operation as I look forward to hear from you for quick conclusion of this transaction.The percentage will be your reward for all your moral and financial assistance during the period of moving the trunk box to your country.You are therefore requested to furnish me through my e-mail address You can reply to my pravite email ( lacson_alice2004@yahoo.com.ph )\n\n\nThanks and I look forward to your urgent message.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMrs Alice.\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3426", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"alice lacson\" <alice_lacson01@atlas.sk> Million five hundred thousand American dollars from my late husband, t=", "alice lacson <alice_lacson01@atlas.sk>"], "dc:format": "multipart/alternative;  co-operation as I look forward to hear from you for quick conclusion o=", "dc:identifier": "<0481ac3eaa2a4fa3b2f197d1f593888a@atlas.sk> security company in Abidjan Cote D Ivoire, in secretly  safe keeping i=", "dc:subject": "Dear partner,", "dc:title": "Dear partner,", "dcterms:created": "2007-01-09T16:07:25Z"}
