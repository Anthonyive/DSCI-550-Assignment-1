My name is Mrs.Marvis\nSmith. I'm a 65 years old woman and from Congo. I was a merchant and\nowned two businesses in Dubai. I was also married with two\nchildren.\n\n\n\nMy husband and two children died in a car accident six\nyears ago. Before this happened, my business and concern for making\nmoney was all I live for. I never really cared about other values in\nlife. But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to\nassist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in\norphanage/motherless homes. I have also donated some money for\nhumanitarian needs in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon, Brazil, Spain,\nAustria, Germany and some Asian countries. Only recently I saw on\ntelevision the colossal loss of properties and livelihood people in\nCanberra, Australia through fire.\n\n\n\nI was moving with great pity and\ncompassion that I decided to make this contribution on assisting people\nover there, I kept $US25,000,000.00 Million in a long-term deposit\naccount in a Finance company. Presently, I'm in a hospital where I have\nbeen undergoing treatment for oesophagi cancer. I have since lost my\nability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only few months\nto live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of\nthe fire outbreak in Australia and other charity organization. Because\nrelatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my\nillness, I cannot live with the agony entrusting this huge\nresponsibility to any of them.\n\n\n\nPlease, I beg you in the name of God\nto help me collect the deposit and  distributes it accordingly. Use your\njudgment to distribute the money and keep 20% of it to yourself. Feel\nfree to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you\nincur during the process of collecting and distributing the money. If\nyou are willing to help, please reply as soon as possible. May the good\nlord bless you and your family.\n\n\n\nPlease, send reply and all\ncorrespondences to my attorney :\n\nBarrister.
