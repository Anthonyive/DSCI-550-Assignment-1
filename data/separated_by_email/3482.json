Because as a \nforeigner, you stand a better position to be presented through documentation \nas the next of kin/Partner since the deceased is also a foreigner, this is \nthe reason why I could not do this deal alone as a staff of the bank as \nwell.\n\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On \nsmooth Conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone \nbills, while 60% will be for me and my partner. Please, you have been \nadvised to keep this \"Top Secret\" as we are still in service and intend to \nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\n\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \nthe money in your bank account. And ask me to come down to your country for \nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \nand further investment,either in your country or any country you advice us \nto invest in.\n\nAll other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from \nyou. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in \nthis deal.\n\nI am expecting your urgent reply as soon as you receive this message.\n\nGod bless you And your family.\n\nDr. Peter Gungula\n\nTell:+ 228 983 34 66\nN/B:Please,for security reason,you should write me further with this e-mail \naccount; pgungula@yahoo.co.uk\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
