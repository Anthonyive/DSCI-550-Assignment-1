President\nOlusegun Obasanjo to probe/review all contracts executed and\npayments made during the regime of late General Sani Abacha.\nI have been mandated by my colleagues on the Committee to\nseek your assistance in the transfer of the sum of\nUS$31.5Million. \n\nAs you may know, the late General Abacha and members of his\ngovernment embezzled billion of dollars through spurious\ncontracts and payments to foreigners between 1993-1998, and\nthis is now the subject of probe by my Committee. In the\ncourse of our review, we have discovered the sum of\nUS$31.5Million,which the former dictator could not transfer\nfrom the dedicated account of the Central Bank of Nigeria\nbefore his sudden death on June 8, 1998. It is this amount\nthat my colleagues and I have decided to acquire for\nourselves through your assistance. This assistance becomes\ncrucial because we cannot acquire the fund in our names. \n\nWe have thus developed a, fool proof, legal and totally risk\nfree arrangement through which the fund can be transferred\nwithin a very short time, if you follow strictly our\ninstructions. The plan is to use our position and influence\non the Committee to present you as a foreign contractor\nbeneficiary of the fund. We shall arrange all documentation\nto support this claim and get Approval for the transfer of\nthe funds for your benefit on our behalf. The arrangement is\nperfected to be 100% risk free and we are sure the\ntransaction can be concluded within 7-10 working days from\nwhen you agree to assist us. \n\nYou should acknowledge the receipt of my mail through the\nabove Telephone and Fax numbers Or E-Mail address so we can\nfurther discuss the modalities of your cooperation and\nnegotiate the charge for your kindly assistance. You were\nhighly recommended and You definitely have a lot to benefit\nfrom this transaction as we are prepared to give you 30% of\nthe total funds as soon as you secure it in your Account. \n\nPlease, endeavour to give me your telephone/fax\nnumber(s)including a bank details  for  the  transfer of the\n above  fund,through which we can communicate with you in\nconfidence (in your response) as the need for strict\nconfidentiality is of essence to this transaction.\n\nPlease i want your reply from this\nemail:<dr_mikechibuzor02@yahoo.com.hk>\n\nWe await your urgent response. \n\nYours Faithfully, \n\nDR.MIKE  CHIBUZOR.\nCHIARMAN CONTRACT\nREVEIW.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3447", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Dr.Mike Chibuzor\" <drmc19472006@yahoo.com.hk>", "Dr.Mike Chibuzor <drmc19472006@yahoo.com.hk>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"", "dc:identifier": "<45acb56d.331.a6c.9381@babbalu.com>", "dc:subject": "DR.MIKE  CHIBUZOR", "dc:title": "DR.MIKE  CHIBUZOR", "dcterms:created": "2007-01-16T11:22:21Z"}
