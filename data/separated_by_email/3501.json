After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we\r\ndiscovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum\r\nCorporation that Engr.Lee Seunghyo died in Korean Air Flight 801, which\r\ncrashed in Guam on August 1997 with other passengers onboard. I\r\ntherefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Lee\r\nSeunghyo died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next\r\nof kin was fruitless.Also, he did not declare any next of kin\r\nor relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit\r\npaperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my\r\nBank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the\r\nend of each year.\r\n\r\nSince the demise of this our customer, I have personally watched the\r\naccount with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved\r\nabortive as no one has come to claim his FIXED DEPOSIT fund of\r\nUSD.$25million, [Twenty five million United States Dollars] which has\r\nbeen with my branch for a very long time. Since his\r\ndeath, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay\r\nclaims for this money asthe heir.\r\n\r\nA member of our government trade delegation to your country gave your\r\nimpeccable profile to me. Hence I have decided to seek your co-operation\r\nin this business deal due to the sensitivity of this transaction. It may\r\ninterest you to know that I am only contacting you as a foreigner\r\nbecause this money cannot be approved to a local Bank account here, but\r\ncan only be approved to a foreigner with an account since the money is\r\nin US Dollars. I have decided as a matter of urgency upon this discovery\r\nnow seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the\r\ndeceased Engr. Lee Seunghyo as No one has ever come forward to claim\r\nthis fund.\r\n\r\nIn accordance to Nigerian Law, fund deposited for a long period of time\r\nwithout claim will be reverted to the Nigerian Government treasury if\r\nnobody applies to claim this fund after a long period of time. I want\r\nyou to co-operate with me so that the fruits of this man's labour will\r\nnot get into the hands of some unsrupulous corrupt government officials\r\nif NOT CLAIMED now.
