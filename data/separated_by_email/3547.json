I feel quite safe \ndealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium \n(Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it \nbecause it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, \nthis correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated \nas such. \n\nAt first I will like to assure you that this transaction is \n100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT \nMONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN \nORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader.\nUntil his death,The Late Prime Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge \ninvestment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a \nmatter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND \nFIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London \nwhich he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about \nthis deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant \ndomiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED \nAND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet \ninvestigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed \naway (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will \napprove this money to any foreigne r because the former operator of the \na/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for \nthe claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with \nlegal claims to the account Holder, \n\nTherefore I need your cooperation \nin this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in \norder to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down \nnow and in future.o.k!
