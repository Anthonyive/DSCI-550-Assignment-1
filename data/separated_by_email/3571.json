On the 2nd of August 2003, my client, his wife\nand their three children were involved in a car accident along Gatwick\nExpress Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.\nSince then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my\nclient\u2019s extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After\nthese several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over\nthe Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I\ncontacted you.\n\u00a0\nI have contacted you to assist me in\nrepatriating the money left behind by my client before they got confiscated\nor declared unserviceable by the Finance House where these huge deposits\nwere lodged. Particularly, the Finance House where the deceased had an\naccount valued at about US$20.7M has issued me a notice to provide the\nnext-of-kin or have the account confiscated within the next Forteen official\nworking days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for\nover nine (9) months now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of\nkin to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$20.7M\ncan be paid to you and then you and I can share the money 60% to me and 35%\nto you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may\nrequired.\n\u00a0\nI have all necessary legal documents that can be used\nto back up any claim we may make, all I require is your honest co-operation\nto enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be\nexecuted under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any\nbreach of the law.\n\u00a0\nAwait your prompt response in my private\nemail address <jkvan@mail.com>\u00a0 for better\ncommunication.\n\u00a0\nYours Sincerely,\n\u00a0\nJack Vanrenos\nEsq.\n\n--\nJack Vanrenos Esq.\njkvan@mail.com\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**This mail was sent by SaigonNet WebMail 1.0\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3523", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"Jack Vanrenos Esq.\" <tunereal@wmail.saigonnet.vn>", "Jack Vanrenos Esq. <tunereal@wmail.saigonnet.vn>"], "dc:format": "text/html; charset=\"utf-8\";", "dc:identifier": "<200702241524.l1OFO82T011862@jacknife.mail.UM>", "dc:subject": "Urgent (Please Reply)", "dc:title": "Urgent (Please Reply)", "dcterms:created": "2007-02-24T15:05:29Z"}
