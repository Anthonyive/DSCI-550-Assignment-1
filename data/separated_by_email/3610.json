I am Isaac Baka, the site insp=\nection director with the ministry ofworks and construction and I worked d=\nirectly with the Minister in charge of the Ministry here in Republic of S=\nudan.=0D\n   =0D\nI awarded a contract to a firm worth several millions of dollars a few ye=\nars ago. In the course of executing the project the firm discovered large=\n gold deposit in one of the construction sites. Being the site director I=\n collaborated with the firm in the mining of the gold on a mutual agreeme=\nnt to share the proceeds out of which I got a share of 7.5 Million. =0D\n=0D\nAs a civil servant in this small war torn country, I cannot introduce thi=\ns funds into the banking system here considering my meager monthly income=\n as well as the code of conduct guidelines regulating civil service here =\nin my country, Sudan. Presently Sudan is engulfed in a civil crisis and a=\ns this crisis intensified by the day, I have decided to move this fund ou=\nt for any profitable venture. The fund will be moved out of Sudan under d=\niplomatic cover as soon as we conclude all procedure.=0D\n=0D\nI therefore solicit for your co-operation to take delivery of this fund i=\nnto your custody for any profitable investment that will be mutually bene=\nficial. I will be able to arrange all necessary procedures to ensure smoo=\nth movement of this funds until you are in control of it.  =0D\n=0D\nPlease let me know if you are interested by return mail to be sent to: (i=\nsbaka@myway.com, isbaka@sify.com). Also include your full names and conta=\nct telephone number to enable me call you.
