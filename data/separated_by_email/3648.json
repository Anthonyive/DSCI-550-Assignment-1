On \nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \ntotal sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of \nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone \nbills, while 65% will be for me and my partners. Please, you have been \nadviced to keep \"top secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire \nfrom service after we conclude this deal with you.\n\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \nto invest in.
