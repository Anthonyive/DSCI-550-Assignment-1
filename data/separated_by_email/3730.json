We are glad to offer you for a \njob position at our company,KELLEYKO FABRICS&TEXTILES We need someone to \nwork for the company as a Representative/Book keeper in the USA and CANADA. This \nis in view of our not having an office presently in the USA AND CANADA. \n\n\u00a0\nOur integrated yarn and fabric manufacturing operations use \nstate-of-the-art textile equipment from the world's leading suppliers. Order \nprocessing,production monitoring and process flow are seamlessly\nintegrated \nthrough a company-wide computer network. \n\u00a0\n* The average monthly \nincome is about 4000.00 USD.\n* No form of investments from you.\n* This job \ntakes only 1-3 hours per day \n\u00a0\nABOUT THE JOB\nWe have sales \nrepresentatives all over the world to distribute our products.You know, that \nit's not easy to start a business in a new market (being the US AND CANADA). \nThere are hundreds of competitors, close direct contacts between suppliers and \ncustomers and other difficulties, which impede our sales promotion.We have \ndecided to deliver the products upfront, it's very risky but it should push up \nsales on 25 percent.We need to get payments for our products as soon as \npossible. Unfortunately we are unable to open Bank Accounts in the United US \nwithout first registering the company name.\n\u00a0\nPresently with the \namount of Orders we have, we cannot put them on hold. For fear of loosing the \ncustomers out rightly. Secondly we cannot cash these payments from the US soon \nenough, as international Checks take about 14 working days for cash to be made \navailable. \n\u00a0\nWe lose about 75,000 USD of net income each month \nbecause we have money transfer delays. \n\u00a0\nYou are not involved in any \nsales. Once orders are received and sorted, we deliver the product to a customer \n(usually through FEDEX/UPS).The customer receives and checks the products. After \nthis has been done the customer has to pay for the products. About 90 percent of \nour customers prefer to pay through Certified Cheque and Money orders based on \nthe amount involved. \n\u00a0\nYOUR TASK ARE:\n1. Receive payment from \nCustomers\n2. Cash Payment at your Bank\n3. Deduct 10% which will be your \npercentage/pay on Payment processed\n4. Forward balance after deduction of \npercentage/pay to any of the offices you will be instructed to send payment to. \n\n\u00a0\nOur payments will be issued out in your name and you can have them \ncashed in your bank or other Cashing Services. Deduct your weekly salary and \nforward the balance to the company via western union money transfer or Money \nGram. We understand it is an unusual and incredible job position. This job takes \nonly 3-7 hours per week. You'll have a lot of free time doing another job, \nyou'll get good income and regular job. \n\u00a0\nThis job is very \nchallenging and you should understand it.
