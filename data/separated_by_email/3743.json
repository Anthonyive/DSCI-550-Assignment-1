I am Mr. Sayid Mustafa the son of late Dr. Malik Mustafa\u00a0 from Sierra Leone. I must confess my agitation is real, and my words is my bond, in this \nproposal\n\u00a0\nMy late father happens to be in control of a large number of farms including cattle\u2019s and many sheep\u00a0before he was poisoned by his foreign business partners in Paris with my mother in one of their farmers association meeting because of greed. \n\u00a0\nBut before his death my late father deposited some amount of money outside our country in a\u00a0bank at the tone of Four Million United States Dollars $4,000.000.00. So I and my little sister\u00a0were no longer safe here as the present government of\u00a0 Sierra Leone are working with almost all the \nkillers of my late father and were looking a way to\u00a0kill us too\u00a0as one of them has\u00a0 just been made a minister, name undisclosed because of security reasons.\n\u00a0\nFurthermore we have contacted the bank where the money\u00a0was deposited and the bankers let us understand that they signed an agreement with our late father that the total money must be transferred into his foreign business partner account undisclosed to them ,therefore because of this reason the money will not be released to us until the foriegn partner of my late father comes for the claim of the money or we should present to them the partner of our late father and that is the major reason why i am contacting you now for assistance so that you can contact the bank as my late father's foriegn partner.\n\u00a0\nAll\u00a0i need\u00a0\u00a0from you now\u00a0 if you have accepted\u00a0 and willing to help us \u00a0when replying is your full names and address including your direct and personal telephone number for easy communication as you know that this transaction is a very confidential one and also assure me that you are really ready to assist us.\n\u00a0\nPlease Kindly get back to me immediately after you must have gone through my message fill free and make it urgent because we are in a very difficult situation now.\u00a0 I am\u00a0offering you 15 % of the total money amount, if you accept to help us transfer this money\u00a0and in case of any necessary expenses you might incur during this transaction.\n\u00a0\nN.B Try and negotiate for me some profitable blue chip investment opportunities which is risky free which I can invest with this money when it is transferred from the bank here, personally I am interested in estate management and hotel business, please advise me.\nFor more explanation and convinction from me please\u00a0write me through my \n\nalternative e-mail address\u00a0 wich i normally check (mustafa2007@jmail.co.za \u00a0)\u00a0or call me\u00a0with this number +225 05519264.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Please note that this is a very important\u00a0 to us\u00a0and if really you will like to help us in this transaction we plead\u00a0that you help us with your heart and sincerity and\u00a0promise me and\u00a0 my younger sister to be a good guardian considering our situation and not to betray us because we believed that Good people still exist..\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are really hoping to hear from you soonest and it will be our greatest joy to know that you have accepted and willing to handle this transaction till the end.\n\n\nThanks and God bless you and your family.\n\n\nBest regards\n\u00a0\nMr.Sayid Mustafa \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWindows Live Spaces : Partagez vos photos des f\u00eates sur votre blog Messenger! \n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3694", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"sayid mustafa\" <son_mustafas50@hotmail.fr>", "sayid mustafa <son_mustafas50@hotmail.fr>"], "dc:format": "text/html; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed", "dc:identifier": "<BAY101-F55B3C693F963482B67CA998460@phx.gbl>", "dc:subject": "CAN I CONFIDE IN YOU?", "dc:title": "CAN I CONFIDE IN YOU?", "dcterms:created": "2007-05-06T20:26:11Z"}
