The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \nbusiness is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I therefore soliciting \nfor your assistance to come forward as the next of kin,\n\nI have agreed that 40% of this money will be for you as the beneficiary in \nrespect of the provision of your Account and services rendered, 55% would be \nfor me while 5% will be for expencses incured during the cause of thIS \ntransaction If the money is transferred to your Account from BANK OF AFRICA, \nI and my family in this transaction will proceed immediately to your country \nfor our own share of the money.\n\nI expect you to keep this business strictly confidential and secret as you \nmay wish to know that I am Bank official. Be rest assured that this business \nis 100% riskfree on both side and every arrangement to transfer this money \nto the Account you are going to provide have been concluded provided we \nmaintain the confidentiality and secreceirity involved.\n\nContact me on my email address I am looking forward for your prompt \nresponse.\n\nYours faithfully,\nMR MUSSA  SANI\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Messenger : appels gratuits de PC \u00e0 PC ! \nhttp://www.msn.fr/newhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3704", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"mussa sani\" <mussa_sani58@hotmail.com>", "mussa sani <mussa_sani58@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed", "dc:identifier": "<BAY118-F102F6F515525C82FB9B21F13E0@phx.gbl>", "dc:subject": "LOOKING FORWARD  FOR YOUR REPLY", "dc:title": "LOOKING FORWARD  FOR YOUR REPLY", "dcterms:created": "2007-05-14T08:27:09Z"}
