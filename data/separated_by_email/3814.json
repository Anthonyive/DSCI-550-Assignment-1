ROBERT JOHN \r\n23 Belgrave Square \r\nLondon SW1X 8PZ\r\nFax: ++44 845 280 0514\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am looking for your cooperation in building a Tourist Hotel or Real Estate in your country. I am sorry if this is not in line with your business. I need an experienced consultant like you to assist me to set up this business and as well develop the project and assume responsibility of ownership as chairman but will be bringing in profit /distribute profit monthly or annually as we may agreed.\r\n\r\nI have US$30 million dollars deposited with a bank in London for safety which I want to invest into real estate or hotel management with any company who can help and manage on behalf of my family, while I will be in partnership with you. If you are interested you can go ahead to look for a suitable place in any city in your country or any country of your\r\nchoice where the business is viable.\r\n\r\nPlease, note that as we progress you may be communicating with my only legal adviser, this is because of my poor health; I have been on sick bed for the past months due to the bomb blast that happened in London.\r\n\r\nDo please indicate your willingness to assist by sending your full names, age, occupation; address, private telephone and fax numbers to enable us commence immediately. I will inform you on the next step to follow.\r\n\r\nYour immediate reply will be highly appreciated and I shall give you more information on this project.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMR. ROBERT JOHN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-3765", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"MR.ROBERT JOHN\" <rjpalaw@uku.co.uk>", "MR.ROBERT JOHN <rjpalaw@uku.co.uk>"], "dc:format": "text/plain", "dc:identifier": "<E1Hzuyn-0002p4-1e@host.webdesignsbyjeffrey.com>", "dc:subject": "Please read", "dc:title": "Please read", "dcterms:created": "2007-06-17T13:39:45Z"}
