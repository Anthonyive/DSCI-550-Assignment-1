From investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account\n is a Japanese Foreigner by name Engineer Meiji Iwatani died on the 4th of January 2001 in an \nautomobile accident. Since then nobody has done anything as regards to the claiming of this money \nas he has no family member is aware of the existence of either the account or the fund.  Information \nfrom the National Immigration also states that late Engineer Meiji Iwatani was single on point of entry into South Africa.\n \nI have confidentially discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and we have agreed to find a \nreliable foreign partner to deal with.
