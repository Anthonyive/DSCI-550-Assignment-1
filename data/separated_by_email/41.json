We have been safeguarding\nthis money for conducive time for it's transfer out of the country for our\npersonal use.

This assurance gave us the courage to link you\nup in this particular transaction and I hope it will be of mutual benefit\nto all of us. Note that the nature of your business is not particularly\nrelevant to the success of the transaction. All we require is your willingness\nto present yourself as the subcontractor by providing your bank information\nso that the fund will be transferred into your account. \nSHARING RATIO:\n For your assistance in this business , your share will be 30% of the total\nfund. I and my colleagues will take 60% while we set aside 10% for any expenses\nthat may incurred in the course of this transaction. If you are willing\nto assist us in this business. Send the following information. \n1. Name of your bank and address \n2. Your account number/beneficiary\u00e2s name. \n3.
