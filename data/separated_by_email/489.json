I am Dr.Faroq Uztaz, a Regional Director with Ghana Commercial Bank with regional office in Accra,Ghana. We had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin)who deposited a huge sum of amount, US$8.5million(Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank. Unfortunately,this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999in U.S.A. However, they were given a ceremonial mass burial near the crash site.Confirmable from the below websites:\r\nwww.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html\r\nwww.fas.org/irp/news/1999/10/\r\nwww.ntsb.gov/events/EA990/default.htm\r\nbut, since then we have not had any body to come for the claims as the next of kin. A sitaution I have monitored closely with my position in the bank.\r\n\r\nNow, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past four years , I have removed the file to my \"private vault\". I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for a foreigner to enable me move the funds to his account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled by me and every loop holes sealed off.\r\n\r\nI therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal. What you stand to gain(%)would be discussed and it is negotiable before the deal commences.\r\n\r\nBelieving to hear from you soonest.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nDr.Faroq Uztaz.\r\n\r\n\r\nN:B:If interested please send your personal telephone and fax numbers.\r\nThanks for your future assistance.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-470", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"Dr.Faroq Uztaz[Regional Director]\" <faroqz10@hotmail.com>", "Dr.Faroq Uztaz[Regional Director] <faroqz10@hotmail.com>"], "dc:format": "application/octet-stream; name=\"dede1.txt\"", "dc:identifier": "<200310131534.h9DFXsfv019891@aquaduct.cs.CU>", "dc:subject": "Request for Assistance!", "dc:title": "Request for Assistance!", "dcterms:created": "2003-10-13T15:34:23Z"}
