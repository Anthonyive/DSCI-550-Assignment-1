It has defiled all forms of\nmedicine, and right now I have only about a few months\nto live, according to medical experts.\n\n\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I\nnever really cared for anyone not even myself but my\nbusiness. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,\nI was always hostile to people and only focus on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But\nnow I regret all this as I now know that there is more\nto life than just wanting to have or make all the\nmoney in the world.\n\n\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to\nthis world I would live my life a different way from\nhow I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I\nhave willed and given most of my properties and assets\nto my immediate and extended family members and as\nwell as a few close friends.\n\n\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and\nso, I have decided to give alms to charity\norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last\ngood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed\nmoney to some charity organizations in the\nU.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has\ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any\nmore. I once asked members of my family to close one\nof my accounts and distribute the money which I have\nthere to charity organization in Bulgaria and\nPakistan, they refused and kept the money to\nthemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore , as\nthey seem not to be contempted with what I have left\nfor them.\n\n\nThe last of my money which no one knows about other\nthan my distant relative who is presently in the\nNetherlands is the huge cash deposit of 8 million\ndollars that I have with a security company in\nAmsterdam.\n\n\nI will want you to help me collect this deposit with\nthe assistance of my relative and dispatch it to\ncharity organizations.If you are interested,please\nemail my cousin at: paulz111@tiscali.co.uk\n\n\nYours Truly\n\n\nMr.Dada Abu.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-520", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["dada abu <dada@fsmail.net>", "dada abu <dada@fsmail.net>"], "dc:format": "text/html", "dc:identifier": "<26947014.1067342384897.JavaMail.www@wwinf3001>", "dc:subject": "hello", "dc:title": "hello", "dcterms:created": "2003-10-28T11:59:44Z"}
