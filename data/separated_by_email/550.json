Zulu, the manager, credit\r\nand foreign bills in African Development Bank Plc.\r\nI am writing in respect of a foreign customer of\r\nmy bank with account number 89-3k7-1996/adb who\r\nperished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801]\r\nwith the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997.\r\n\r\nSince the demise of this our customer, whom I could not care lessa\r\nbout,\r\nI personally\r\nhave watched with keen interest to see the next of kin\r\nbut all has proved abortive as no one has come to\r\nclaim his funds of us$.57 m, [Fifty seven million\r\nunited states dollars] which has been with my branch\r\nfor a very long time.\r\n\r\nOn this note, I decided to seek for whom his name\r\ncould be used as the next of kin as no one has come up\r\nto be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here\r\ndoes not allow such money to stay more than seven\r\nyears, because the money will be recalled to the bank\r\ntreasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of\r\nthis I got your contact through my search via business\r\nreport from your web site to see if you can assist. I\r\nwill give you 25% of the total.\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of your response, I will send to you\r\nby fax or e-mail the application letter, bank's fax\r\nnumber and the next step to take. I will not fail to\r\nbring to your notice that this business is hitch free\r\nand that you should not entertain any fear as all\r\nmodalities for fund transfer can be finalized within\r\nfive banking days, after you apply to the bank as a\r\nrelation to the deceased.\r\nWhen you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail\r\nsignifying Your decision including your private\r\nTel/Fax numbers for quick communication.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nMusa A Zulu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-530", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["\"MUSA AHMED ZULU\" <musma_adb@ny.com>", "MUSA AHMED ZULU <musma_adb@ny.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"", "dc:identifier": "<200311032210.hA3MA3ck020901@brokenways.mr.itd.UM>", "dc:subject": "please assist", "dc:title": "please assist", "dcterms:created": "2003-10-31T14:12:59Z"}
