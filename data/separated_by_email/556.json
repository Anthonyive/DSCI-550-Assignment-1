I am writing following an impressive information about you through an internet business proposal .I decided to introduce this business opportunity to you.\r\nIn my departmentn we discovered an abandoned sum of US$16.M (SIXTEEN MILLION, UNITED STATES DOLLARS).In an account that belongs to one of ourforeign customer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane crash.\r\n\r\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guideline\r\ns but unfortunately welearnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim and other officials.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that we decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want\r\nthis money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\r\n\r\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after four years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.\r\n\r\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\r\n\r\nwe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my colleagues.\r\n\r\nThere after we will visit your country for disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indi\r\ncating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have b\r\neen made for the transfer.\r\n\r\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\r\n\r\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\r\n\r\nYour's faithfully,\r\n\r\nMR.lucman Watson\r\nAfrican Development bank ADB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-536", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["\"MR.lucman Watson\" <lucman_watson@macmail.com>  Manage Folders   ", "MR.lucman Watson <lucman_watson@macmail.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"     ", "dc:identifier": "<200311060144.hA61iPJU023974@fate.mr.itd.UM>     ", "dc:subject": "Urgent needed", "dc:title": "Urgent needed", "dcterms:created": "2003-11-06T01:44:30Z"}
