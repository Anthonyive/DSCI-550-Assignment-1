USMAN BELLO\n\nFROM THE DESK OF DR. USMAN BELLO\nUNION BANK PLC\nMy name is Usman Bello the manager, credit and foreign bills of Union Bank Nigeria Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,1998.\nSince the demise of this client customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of USD$.30 m, [Thirty million United States dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for a foreigner who I can present as the next of kin hence no one has come up to be the next of kin.\nAnd the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more Than five years, after which the money will be called into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds after this period. In view of this I got your contact from a business contact enquiry. Note that you do not need to have similar names with the late beneficiary. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I will commence on manipulating your information into the file as the next of kin and I will send you information on how we intend to actualize our objective in a legal manner.\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after your claim is established as the certified next of kin to\nThe deceased. \nWhen you receive this letter. Kindly, send me your private Tel/Fax Numbers for quick communication through my private email box at dr_usmanbello20033@yahoo.com\nAwaiting your favorable response.\nYours truly,\nDr. Usman Bello \n\n Freeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save \u00a37.50 a month \nwww.freeserve.com/anytime", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-593", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "2", "dc:creator": ["DR USMAN BELLO <dr_usmanbello@fsmail.net> tromer@lyon.k12.nv.us, jruff@lyon.k12.nv.us, gsuarez@lyon.k12.nv.us, edonoghue@saintpetersuh.com, jsignor@e-z.net, cory@dhart.com, mhjmitz@aol.com, garrylawes@hotmail.com, charliebrown99@talk21.com, fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you=", "DR USMAN BELLO <dr_usmanbello@fsmail.net>"], "dc:format": "text/html", "dc:identifier": "<30547158.1071017274328.JavaMail.www@wwinf3001> sreiger@lyon.k12.nv.us, srieger@lyon.k12.nv.us, dhart@harbourrocks.com.au, dhart@ecs.giswave.com, dhart@ecps.us, ve7ibv@hotmail.com, dvchis@bigpond.net.au, lyndaw@optusnet.com.au, treasury as unclaimed funds after this period.
