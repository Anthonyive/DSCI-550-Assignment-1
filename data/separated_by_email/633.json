There Is an Account opened in this bank\nin 1980 and since 1990 no body has Operated on this account again.

The owner of this account is Dr.Phillip Morris , a Foreigner and a miner at delth Gold Co, a geologist by Profession. He died since 1990. And no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it.
