Right now, the new Civilian Government headed by president olusegun obasanjo have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw this US$12,000,000.00 from our  company's vault and deposited it with another Security Company for safe keeping. l have since declared our Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existedconcerning the money traceable by the government because  there is no documentation showing that we received this money from our Russian business partners.\r\n\r\nDue to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within.
