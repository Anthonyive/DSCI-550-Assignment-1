Though I am very rich, I was never \ngenerous, I was always hostile to people and only \nfocused on my business as that was the only thing I \ncared for. But now I regret all this as I now know \nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have \nor make all the money in the world. \nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come \nto this world I would live my life a different way \nfrom how I have lived it. Now that God has called \nme, I have willed and given most of my property \nand assets to my immediate and extended family \nmembers as well as a few close friends. \nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul \nso, I have decided to give alms to charity \norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last \ngood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed \nmoney to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, \nAlgeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has \ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself \nanymore. I once asked members of my family to close one \nof my accounts and distribute the money which I have \nthere to charity organization in Bulgaria and \nPakistan, they refused and kept the money to \nthemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as \nthey seem not to be contended with what I have left \nfor them. \nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the \nhuge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars \n$18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company \nabroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit \nand dispatched it to charity organizations.\nI have set aside 10% for you and for your time.\nGod be with you. \nBATES ALAN\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-719", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["MRBATESALANN@netscape.net", "MRBATESALANN@netscape.net"], "dc:identifier": "<200402211554.i1LFssJj029948@aquaduct.cs.CU>", "dc:subject": "REPLY SOON", "dc:title": "REPLY SOON", "dcterms:created": "2004-02-21T15:54:54Z"}
