Early last yearthere was a\nmajor oil spillage in\nthe Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over\n70% of the\ncommunities homeless.The contract was handled by a\nforeign firm but\nbecause of the huge monetary profit we envisaged, we\ndecided to\nover-invoice the contract\nsum. Now the contract has been completed and the\noriginal contractor has\nsince been paid,but the contract balance of US$31.50\nmillion(THIRTY-ONE\nMILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES\nDOLLARS),which resulted from\nthe over invoiced contract sum that has been left in a\nsuspense account\nwith the CENTRAL BANK of NIGERIA,is what me and my\npartners are planning\nto take out of the country for ourselves.The problem\nis as government\nofficials,we are not suppose to own fat bank\naccounts,talk less of having\nforeign ones.\n\nTo this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a\nforeign partner who\ncan assist us and receive this amount into your\naccount. We are ready to\nshare this money with you on the basis of\nparticipation. We also have\nplans to invest part of this money in any viable\nbusiness in your country\nunder your care,as we are nearing our retirement age.\n\nIn any case, I received a reference of\nyou/organization from the Nigeria\nChambers of Commerce and Industry 'Foreign Trade\nDivision' as a reputable\norgan that can assist us on this transaction. Please\nif you accept my\nproposal do not hesitate to send me a send me an\ne-mail  so that I can\nprovide you with the basic procedures for the release\nof the fund.\n\nIt does not matter whether you or your company does\ncontract project of\nthe nature described here, the assumption is that you\nwon a major contract\nand subcontracted it to another company, more often\nthannot, big trading\ncompanies or individuals of unrelated field win major\ncontracts here in\nNigeria and subcontracts same to more specialized\nfirms for execution.\n\n BENEFIT: For providing the account where we shall\nremit this money, you\nwill be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% will\nbe for me and my\npartners,while 5% has been set aside to cover any\nexpenses that may be\nincurred by both parties during this transaction, both\nlocal and\ninternational.\n\n Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with\nutmost degree of\nmaturity and confidentiality because I am still in\nactive government\nservice with the\"NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM\nCORPORATION\". If I receive\nyour response on time, this whole transaction could be\naccomplished within\nthe shortest possible time based on your interest and\ndetermination,since the money is already in transit.\n\nAwaiting your urgent response and thanks for your\nanticipated co operation\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDr.JERRY M AHMED  \n\nREPLY TO (jerrymahmed@regards.net)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-742", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "dc:identifier": "<20040309154622.22584.qmail@web107.biz.mail.yahoo.com> My name is DR.JERRY M AHMED   a member of the", "dc:subject": "urgent buiness proposal", "dc:title": "urgent buiness proposal"}
