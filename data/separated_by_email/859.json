I am married to Dr.Alan George Peters\r\nwho worked with south africa embassy in nigeria for\r\nnine years before he died in the year 2001.\r\n\r\nWe were married for eleven years without a child. He\r\ndied after a brief illness that lasted for only four\r\ndays. Before his death we were both born again\r\nChristians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry\r\nor get a child outside my matrimonial home which the\r\nBible is against.When my late husband was alive he\r\ndeposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven Million\r\nsix hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one\r\nfinance/security company in Europe.\r\n\r\nPresently, this money is still with the Security\r\nCompany. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not\r\nlast for the next three months due to cancer problem.\r\nThough what disturbs me most is my stroke.\r\n\r\n Having known my condition I decided to donate this\r\nfund to church or better still a christian individual\r\nthat will utilize this money the way I am going to\r\ninstruct here in. I want a church or individual that\r\nwill use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows\r\npropagating the word of God and to ensure that the\r\nhouse of God is maintained. The Bible made us to\r\nunderstand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.\r\n\r\nI took this decision because I don?t have any child\r\nthat will inherit this money and my husband relatives\r\nare not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hard\r\nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t\r\nwant a situation where this money will be used in an\r\nungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold\r\ndecision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where\r\nI am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom\r\nof the Lord.\r\n\r\nExodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case\r\nand I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone\r\ncommunication in this regard because of my health,and\r\nbecause of the presence of my husband?s relatives\r\naround me always. I don?t want them to know about this\r\ndevelopment. With God all things are possible. As soon\r\nas I receive your reply I shall give you the contact\r\nof the Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also\r\nissue you a letter of authority that will empower you\r\nas the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you\r\nand the church to always pray for me because the lord\r\nis my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of\r\na worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the\r\nLord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always\r\nbe prayerful all through your\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAny delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing\r\nfor a church or christian individual for this same\r\npurpose. Please assure me that you will act\r\naccordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nplease reply me through this email;\r\n<mrsjfpeters@postmaster.co.uk>\r\n\r\nRemain blessed in the name of the Lord.\r\nYours in Christ,\r\nMrs Juliana faith peters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nBroadband from an unbeatable \u00a315.99!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadband/home.html?code=SM-NL-11AM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-832", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "1", "dc:creator": ["Mrs. Juliana Faith Peters", "Mrs Juliana Faith Peters <mrsjfp11@tiscali.co.uk>"], "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"", "dc:subject": "Dearest friend", "dc:title": "Dearest friend"}
