Here in this bank\n existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which\n belong to a Syria national who is now late.\n \n When we discovered that there had been no deposits nor\n withdrawals from this account for this long period, I\n and my two other colleagues decided to carry out a\n system investigation and discovered that non of the\n family member nor relations of the late Syrian is\n aware of this account.\n \n This is the story in a nutshell.\n \n Now we want an account overseas where we can transfer\n this funds. Thereafter, we had planned to destroy all\n related documents for this account. It is a careful\n network and for the past eleven months we have worked\n out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation.\n \n \n The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all\n the accumulated interest the balance in this account\n stands at-US$9,000.000.00 million US dollars.\n \n Now our questions are:-\n \n 1. Can you handle this project?\n 2. Can we give you this trust?\n 3. What will be your commission?\n \n Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible.\n \n Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as\n contained herein be accorded the necessary\n attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.\n \n We Expect your urgent response if you can handle this\n project. send a mail for confirmation.\n \n \n Respectfully yours,\n \n MR.Daniel Innoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp://Game.37.com/  <--- Free Games\nhttp://newJoke.com/   <---  J O K E S  ! ! !\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-86", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "2", "dc:creator": ["\"daniel innocent\" <daninno555@37.com> and my two other colleagues decided to carry out a  Respectfully yours,", "daniel innocent <daninno555@37.com>"], "dc:format": "text/plain leading banks in the West Coast).
