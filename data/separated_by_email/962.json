We have seen reforms after reforms by the government of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in shambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to relocate our farm to Swaziland, a neighbouring country, where we have acquired lands. Our capital base is in South Africa where we are temporarily living pending such time logistics would be ready for full-scale operation in Swaziland. Bearing in mind that Mr. Thabo Mbeki (South African president) and his government are playing Russian roulette over the Zimbabwean land crisis, every effort has begun in earnest to move our capital base to a stable country where it can be safer. \n\u00a0\nWith a capital base of US$25.5Million, there is a great deal of secrecy involved to avoid the piercing eyes and smelling noses of both the governments of Zimbabwe and South !\n Africa.\n We are therefore contacting you so you can use a magnificent business technique to transfer this financial treasure out of South Africa.
