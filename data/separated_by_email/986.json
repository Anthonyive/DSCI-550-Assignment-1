We took along with us the\nmoney my father kept in the safe in my mothers\nhouse,which amounted to the sum of US$16.7Million\n(sixteen Million,Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars) to\nthe Republic of South Africa.where we now seek political asylum. the money\nhas been tranfered to a finacial house overseas\n\nMy Mother and I have decided to contact any reliable\noverseas firm who could assist us to claim this\nmoney out from the finacial house because we as asylum seeker\nhere in South Africa we are not allowed certain\nfinancial rights like operating a bank account.\nWe need you to\nopen a non-resident account through which this fund\nwill be channeled out to your nominated overseas\naccount.If my preposition is considered, for assisting\nus to transfer this money to your country, we will\noffer you 3million dollars of the total fund, while me and my\nfamily will like to invest in your country under your guidance\nand assistance.\nThis transaction is 100% risk free.Your urgent\nresponse to my personal box  will be highly appreciated.\n(mafikeng_c@front.ru) anxiously waiting for you reply. thank you.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\nclaudia Mafikeng.\nFor the family.\n\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-958", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:creator": ["claudiamafikeng@caltanet.it", "claudiamafikeng@caltanet.it"], "dc:format": "text/plain;charset=iso-8859-1", "dc:identifier": "<54639.80.179.107.245.1088429916.squirrel@webmail.caltanet.it>", "dc:subject": "Greetings!", "dc:title": "Greetings!", "dcterms:created": "2004-06-28T13:38:36Z"}
