On maturity, The bank sent a routine\nnotification to his forwarding address but got no\nreply. \n\nAfter a month,The bank sent another reminder and\nfinally his contract employers,the South African\nMining corporation wrote to inform the bank that\nMr.Gregory A.Williams died from an automobile\naccident,that he died without MAKING A WILL, and all\nattempts by the American Embassy to trace his next of\nkin was fruitless. \n\nI therefore, made further investigation and discovered\nthat Mr.Gregory A.Williams in fact was an immigrant\nfrom Jamaica and only recently obtained American\ncitizenship.He did not declare any kin or relations in\nall his official documents, including his Bank deposit\npaper work. This money total U S $ 14,200,000.00 is\nstill sitting in my bank as dormant Account. \n\nNo one will ever come forward to claim it, and\naccording to South African banking policy,after\n5years, the money will revert to the ownership of the\nSouth African Government if the account owner is\ncertified dead. This is the situation, and my proposal\nis that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in\nas the next of kin to Mr.Gregory A.Williams,and a Bank\nAccount abroad will then facilitate the transfer of\nthis money to the beneficiary/ next of kin.\n\nThis is simple, all you have to do is to immediately\nsend me a bank account anywhere in the world for me to\narrange the proper money transfer paperwork. This\nmoney total USD ($14.2M) will then be paid into this\nAccount for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25\n% for you and 5% for expenses that might come up\nduring transfer process. There is no risk at all, and\nall the paper work for this transaction will be done\nby me using my position and connection in the banks in\nSouth Africa.\n\nThis business transaction is guaranteed. If you are\ninterested, please reply immediately through my\npersonal email sending the following details:\n\n(1) Your Full Name/Address.\n\n(2) Your Private Telephone/fax Number.\n\n(3) Your Bank Name And Address.\n\n(4) Your Account Number: \n\nAnd Sweft Code (If Any)\n\n(5) Account Name.\n\nPlease observe the utmost confidentiality, and rest\nassured that this transaction would be most profitable\nfor both of us because I shall require your assistance\nto invest my share in your country.\n\nI look forward to your earliest reply through  my\nprivate email address <ctiboudey@yahoo.ca> Please for\nthe security of this business ok. Thanks and god bless\nyou and your family and bless me too.\n\nHave a nice day.    \n\nYours truly.\n\nMr.Ctibor Pilna\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ \nPost your free ad now! http://personals.yahoo.ca\n\n\n\n", "X-TIKA:content_handler": "ToTextContentHandler", "X-TIKA:embedded_depth": "1", "X-TIKA:embedded_resource_path": "/embedded-961", "X-TIKA:parse_time_millis": "0", "dc:format": "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1", "dc:identifier": "<20040630021632.26738.qmail@web25208.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>", "dc:subject": "From Mr.Ctibor Pilna/Reply.
