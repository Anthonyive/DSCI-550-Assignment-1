More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.\\n\\nThis amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.\\n\\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.

The key for us building up this mutual relationship is TRUST between both parties involved that is you and I.  I am in charge of the Auditing for contract payment with SAFA (South African Football Association) and I truly apologize for using this means to reach you for I have no other choice. Within the South African Football Association and the cooperation of my colleague, I have in my possession as overdue payment bills totaling Thirty Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$38.5M). With your assistance and fullest co-operation, I on behalf of my colleague beg you to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presently lying in a suspended account with ABSA Bank in Pretoria branch. It does matter whether it is a corporate or personal account but as long as the account is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very ok to us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operate offshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important towards the successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall both benefits from. This US$38.5M arose from the balance of the total contract value for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria, Johannesburg and Soweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it was awarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president Mr Nelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately, though the actual contract cost have been fully paid to the original contractor. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us (which I prayed and beg for) in the transaction; your share of the sum will be 25% of the total amount after Tax in any account you shall provide for the funds to be transferred into, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistance we shall invest in property management/real estate business in your country. And that is why we offered you 25% of the total amount not just to receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred to your account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life I have been a civil servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nEndeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel and Fax number or my e-mail address: (DSolow@latinmail.com) if you are willing to help in this matter and I also want to guarantee you that my partner and myself are in a better position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation of your earliest response. \\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly, \\r\\nDr. Daniel Solow\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I am 25\\r\\nyears old and a graduate of Mass Communication. My\\r\\nfather was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil\\r\\nproducing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of\\r\\nreviving royalties from the multi-national oil\\r\\ncompanies and government on behalf of the oil\\r\\nproducing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of\\r\\nthe Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late\\r\\ndictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered\\r\\nstroke and died in August27th last year. But before\\r\\nhis death, he called me and told me he has sixthy six Million United States Dollars\\r\\n(USD66,000,000.00) cash in his possession, specially\\r\\ndeposited in a Security vault company in eroupe. He\\r\\nadvised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is\\r\\nthe last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married.\\r\\nMy mother did not bear any male child for him. Which\\r\\nimplies that all my father?s properties, companies\\r\\ne.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has\\r\\nno male child according to African Tradition. My\\r\\nfather therefore secretly gave me all the relevant\\r\\ndocuments of the said money, and told me that I should\\r\\nuse this money with my mother and my younger sisters\\r\\nbecause he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we\\r\\ncannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly\\r\\nadvised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and\\r\\nthat I should not invest this money here in Nigeria\\r\\nbecause of his other wives and male children who\\r\\nhappen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your\\r\\nimmediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I\\r\\nwill live with my mother and two younger sisters and\\r\\nfurther advise me where and how I will invest the\\r\\nbalance money overseas, possibly on products of your\\r\\ncompany and other profitable ventures. I believe that\\r\\nby the special grace of God, you will help us move\\r\\nthis money out of eroupe to your country where we can\\r\\ninvest this money judiciously with you. You are\\r\\nentitled to a reasonable part of this money based on\\r\\nour agreement, and God will bless you as you help us.\\r\\nPLease reply through my e-mail Looking forward to hear\\r\\nfrom you as soon as possibleand also my lawyer\\r\\nemail address:(adekunle_smithmike@hotmail.com).

One of my clients whom I have \\npersonally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car \\ncrash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and \\na two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to \\nbe cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only \\nfamily and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al \\nKharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of \\nhis fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah \\nOil Field).\\n\\xa0\\nAll subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was \\nprivately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and \\nother officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his \\naccounts now \\ndecided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the \\nportfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the \\ndeceased.\\n\\xa0\\nThe reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his \\nwife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an \\nattempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for \\ngiving birth outside \\nmarriage. So we have decided to help her by making this \\nproposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharj’s \\nproperty for her \\nand her son.\\n\\xa0\\nYou must be asking where I got \\nyour mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia \\nPhilips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment \\nexpansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and \\naccounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years \\nrunning, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in \\nthe old records recognizing \\nyou as the only beneficiary.\\n\\xa0\\nThe \\nbanking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four \\nyears it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as \\nbeneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not \\npermanently \\nresident in Switzerland.\\n\\xa0\\nFor your assistance, we made up of I, 2 \\nsenior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti \\nGovernment pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to \\nmake available 25% of all bank \\nfunds cleared and 15% of the royalties which \\nyou will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every \\nyear. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the \\nestates and property are \\nconcerned, as they will be going to the surviving \\nwife and child.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are okay with the above explanations, you \\nmay reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may \\nconfirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you \\non how we will \\nproceed.\\n\\xa0\\nI must further assure you that this \\ntransaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being \\nhandled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my \\nfirms website at www.royaltrust.com.\\n\\xa0\\nWe await \\nyour timely response.\\n\\xa0\\nBest Regards\\n\\xa0\\nDR PETER \\nCLAPTON\\n',\n",

During\\nthe war\\nwaged against the farmers in Zimbabwe by the\\nsupporters and\\ncohorts of President Robert Mugabe to\\nclaim all the white owned farms in our\\ncountry, my\\nlate husband belonged to one of the classes of farmers\\nalso\\ntargeted by the ZANU-PF armed group,because he\\ndid not support theirideas and\\npolicies of taking\\nwhite farmers \\nland by force. \\n\\n\\n\\nBlackwar veterans claiming tobe farmers, invaded my\\nhusband\\'s house on\\nApril 17, 2000 at about 8.35pm in\\nMacheke/Virginia district and murdered him\\nbecause of\\nhis insistence that white farmers be allowed to retain\\ntheir\\nfarmlands despite the\\xa0 recently introduced land\\nreforms\"Act\" in Zimbabwe\\nby \\nthe head of state,President Robert Mugabe. \\n\\n\\nUntil his death he was one of the prominent members of\\nthe Zimbabwean\\nFarmers\\'Union (ZFU)But before my\\nhusbands death, he first escaped safely\\ninto\\nneighbouring South Africa with his life time fortune\\nof\\nUS$37m(Thirty-seven Million \\nUSdollars)cash, important documents of property\\ntitle\\nand other \\nvaluables which were concealed and secured in a\\ntrunk\\nbox, and \\ntransported to Johannesburg through diplomatic means. \\n\\n\\nThe consignment box is currently safely lodged and\\nsecured in the vaults\\nof a private security firm here\\nin Johannesburg after which he returned to\\nzimbabwe\\nwhile he was killed. The fund was meant for the\\npurchase of new\\ntractors,machinery and agro-allied\\nchemicals for our new farms acquired in\\nSwaziland. \\n\\n\\nThis land problem came when President\\xa0 Robert Mugabe\\nintroduced a new\\nland act\"ModusOperandi\" reform which\\nwholly affected the rich white farmers.\\nA lot of\\npeople were killed because of this land reforms \"Act\"\\nof which my\\nlate husband was one of the main\\ntargets.Based on this,I had to flee the\\ncountry with\\nmy \\ntwo children and my only late husband\\npersonal\\nassistance [PA] Mr Chris Mutembi who was his\\npersonal\\nassistant{PA}. \\nWe are now in south africa as political\\nassylum\\nseekers/refugees. \\n\\n\\nWe decided to contact you to assist us in removing\\nthis money my husband\\nkept in a private security\\ncompany here in south africa to your account or\\nany\\npart of the world for investments as the\\nmonetary/investment laws here\\nin south africa\\nprohibits refugees and illegal immigrants from\\noperating\\nbank accounts or be involved in any\\ntransaction/investment. Based on this,\\n\\nwe are contacting you hoping that you will assist us\\nwith this\\ntransaction. \\n\\n\\nAs a widow, I am saddled with the responsibility of\\nseeking a genuine and\\nan honest person who will assist\\nus in investing this money in a highly\\nprofit yeilding\\nventures without the knowledge of\\nmy\\ncountry(Zimbabwe)government who are bent on taking\\neverything my late\\nhusband \\nhad after confiscating all his farmlands and\\ninvestments in\\nZimbabwe \\n. \\n\\n\\nWe are absolutely left with nothing except the money\\nhe deposited in a\\nprivate security company here in\\nsouth africa. In recognition of\\ninvestment\\nopportunities that abound in so many contries in the\\nworld , I\\nsolicit for your \\nassistance to us by moving my family money into\\nyour\\ncountry/ bank account for safekeeping pending our\\nfuture arrival for\\ninvestments in your country or\\nelsewhere you may wish. \\n\\n\\nThe family has resolved to adequately offer a share \\nof 15% of the money\\nto you for your involvement and\\nassistance to our family in moving the entire\\nmoney\\nout of SouthAfrica. \\n\\n\\nPlease call\\xa0 Mr Chris Mutembi on telephone \\nnumber+27-738151680 [or]\\nsend him a fax on fax number\\n+27-11-5075944\\nfor further briefing on what\\nyou need to do, \\nif my letter and request is of any interest to you.\\nwhile\\nI implore you to maintain\\nabsolute confidentiality required in this\\ntransaction\\nconsidering our situation here in south africa.

This scheme has over US$500,000,000,00 involves targeted investment in health, education and farming to help lift African villages out of poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently we have currently covers around 107 villages in 13 countries, including, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya. Under the scheme, villages are supplied with various materials, e.g. mosquito nets to prevent the spread of malaria, fertilizers, clothing of various kinds and treatment for people living with HIV/Aids. This scheme makes up part of the UN'S Millennium Development Goals, which are internationally agreed targets to cut poverty, hunger, disease and boots literacy by 2015 in Africa. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am contacting you for a business; I would like you to register with our agency as one of our foreign suppliers that supplys relief materials to our organization. I have about US$8MILLION to transfer into any secured bank account abroad. The money is an over-invoiced contract amount executed by a foreign supplier and commissioned with African Millennium Villages project (AMVP), and the original supplier has been paid since march last year remaining the over-invoiced amount of $8million. This was intentional and since then the US$8million has been in the suspense account of our organization awaiting for claim.

Then you will serve among the foreign suppliers that supplied relief material to our organization awaiting for payment.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll arrangements have been put in place to ensure a successful project. Please if you are capable of working this project with me get back to me quickly via this email:deansammer033@yahoo.com. We will discuss on the sharing modality of the fund if i receive your positive response. I will send you more details on how we are going to proceed on the claim. Note this project is risk free and genue.With your corporation it will only take just few weeks to accomplish our project.\\r\\n \\r\\nKind regards\\r\\n \\r\\nMr.D S Ammer \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for \\r\\nyou.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian \\r\\nNational \\r\\nPetroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) \\r\\nDeposit \\r\\nfor \\r\\ntwelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty- five Million \\r\\nDollars) in my branch.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \\r\\nbut got \\r\\nno reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered \\r\\nfrom \\r\\nhis \\r\\ncontract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that \\r\\nMr. Barry \\r\\nKelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I \\r\\nfound out \\r\\nthat he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next \\r\\nof kin \\r\\nto date has fruitless.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry \\r\\nKelly did \\r\\nnot declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, \\r\\nincluding his \\r\\nBank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is \\r\\nstill \\r\\nsitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the \\r\\nprincipal \\r\\nsum \\r\\nat the end of each year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNo one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, \\r\\nat the \\r\\nexpiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of \\r\\nthe \\r\\nNigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, \\r\\nmy \\r\\nproposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the \\r\\nnext of \\r\\nkin \\r\\nto Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man’s labor will not \\r\\nget \\r\\ninto \\r\\nthe hands of some corrupt government  officials.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names, \\r\\naddress, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the \\r\\nnecessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the \\r\\nnext of \\r\\nkin. We shall employ the service of another Attorney for drafting and \\r\\nnotarization \\r\\nof the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of \\r\\nprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will \\r\\nthen \\r\\nfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of \\r\\nkin.  \\r\\nThe money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in \\r\\nthe \\r\\nratio \\r\\nof 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on \\r\\neither \\r\\nsides during the course of this transaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will \\r\\nbe done \\r\\nby the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the \\r\\nsuccessful \\r\\nexecution of this transaction. Upon your \\r\\nresponse, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant \\r\\ndocuments \\r\\nthat will help you understand the transaction better. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this \\r\\ntransaction \\r\\nwould be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your \\r\\nassistance \\r\\nto invest my share in your country.

I am Mr.Jonathan Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bongani,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. \\n  Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. \\nThis land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \"modus operandi\" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. \\n precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\\'s plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe\\'s new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father\\'s money into a foreign account. \\n  As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa\\'s government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an \"ASYLUM\". \\n  As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. \\nFinally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company\\'s account in your country. \\n If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address. \\nBest Regards.\\n \\nJonathan Bongani(For the Family).\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.\\n\\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. \\n\\nMy Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!\\nnd) to seek for political asylum.\\n\\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. \\n\\nPresident Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.\\n\\nI plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.\\n\\nYour role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. \\n\\nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. \\n\\nI have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.\\n\\nI thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. \\n\\nPlease contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.\\n\\nTo know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the links below and read. \\n\\nhttp://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.html\\n\\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm\\n\\nSincerely,\\nO.C.Savimbi.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I gathered your information from my country's international chamber of trade and commerce, The business I am about to introduce is basedon sheer trust and with a sense of purpose.I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the sum of ($15.2M)u.S dollars.The money and property left behind by Dr.Solomon who died accidentally On the 21st of April 2000, Dr Solomon Komana, his wife and their two Children were killed by rebels on the past crisis in Liberia during the Time of their formal president Charles Taylor near their village called Kuru .I gathered all this information through a good source after my several routine note to his forwarding address. Because he had served here in Dakar Senegal as a business consultant with the Senegalaise National Petroleum & Gas Corperation.SNPGC and a special ass advise to the OPEC.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then I have made several enquiries to his embassy here in Dakar senegal to locate any of his extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you as his account officer to work with you before the fund get confiscate or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. Particularly. Now the management has been dlibrating on how to revert this fund to the bank privacy and Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3 years now,I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased since you are a foriegner so that the proceeds of this account valued at $15.200,000:00 can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% will be maped out for any miscellaneous expenses that might incure in the cause of this transaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have all the necessary legal documents to back up this claim, and this I must do to make sure that this fund is not wasted or end up in the wrong hands. All I require is your honest and sincere co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee you that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you and I from any breach of the law. Reply me through my e-mail address (mranijah_akpundu@voila.fr) Looking forward to hear from you at this private e-mail for security purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours Sincerely,\\r\\nMR Anijah Akpundu.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

And for your \\nperusal you can view this web site:http://news.bbc.co.\\nuk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm and since then nobody has done anything \\nas  regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members \\nwho are aware of the existence of the account nor the funds.\\n\\nAlso \\nInformation from the National Immigration stated  that he was also \\nsingle on entry into South Africa.\\n  \\nI have secretly discussed this \\nmatter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to find a reliable \\nforeign partner to deal with. In fact we could have done this deal \\nalone but because of our position in this country as civil servants,we \\nare not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually \\nraise an eye brows on our side during the time of transfer since we \\nstill work in this bank, this is the actual reason why we required a \\nsecond party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of \\nkin with informations which will be made available to you.\\n \\nThis \\ntransaction is totally risk and trouble free as  the fund is legitimate \\nand does not originate from  drugs, money laundering, terrorism or any \\nother illegal act. \\n   \\nThe sharing of the fund between us, is as \\nfollows; 40% of the total sum will go to you for your effort and \\ncommitment to the success of this transaction. 60% for me and my \\ncolleague's. \\n \\nForward your reply to jomutambara@fsmail.net \\n  \\nBest \\nRegards, \\nMr.Jonathan Mutambara\\nEmail: jomutambara@fsmail.net \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

It has defiled all forms of medical\\r\\ntreatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according\\r\\nto medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I\\r\\nnever really cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I\\r\\nam very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and\\r\\nonly focused on my business as\\r\\nthat was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now\\r\\nknow that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the\\r\\nmoney in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to\\r\\nthis world I\\r\\nwould live my life a different way from how I have lived it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property\\r\\nand assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few\\r\\nclose friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I\\r\\nhave decided\\r\\nto give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want this to\\r\\nbe one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed\\r\\nmoney to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health\\r\\nhas deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked\\r\\nmembers of my family to\\r\\nclose one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to\\r\\ncharity organization in United States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they\\r\\nrefused and kept the money to themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with\\r\\nwhat I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is\\r\\nthe huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000,\\r\\n000.00) that I\\r\\nhave with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I will want you\\r\\nto help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations\\r\\nand use it to help those in Need.\\r\\n\\r\\nN/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami,\\r\\nHurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to\\r\\nother Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am\\r\\nusing my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you.

When I was searching for a reliable individual or private company that can assist me to transfer a reasonable amount in a safe account abroad on behalf of my late husband, two sons and two daughters. I decided to solicit your assistance to transfer this sum of US $20 Million (Twenty Million, United States Dollars)inherited from my late husband in to your personal company’s account or private account.Before his death, he was a Brigadier in charge of arms and ammunition procurement for the (DRC) army. In his WILL?he specifically draws my attention to this US$ 20 Million which he deposited in a safe box in Private Security Company in South Africa. \\xa0During the war, he was very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the rebels until when he found out that some Senior Army Officers and Government Functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties and sending them toforeign countries. Due to this, he and his former special advisers to the president were assigned by the President (Laurent Kabila) to purchase arms in South Africa, they saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and divided it and he got a total sum of US $20 Million. He deposited the box in my son’s name and him alone with the deposit code canclaim it.\\n\\nI will be grateful if you can assist us now. I want you to do for us as an international partner to help us transfer this money which is in a safety box in the Security Company using your name as the beneficiary of\\nthis sum. You can contact \\xa0me or my son (George Yangani) \\xa0in\\nSouth Africa on \\xa0this number+27 8046828612. Then, we will tell you more details about it. We are in position to inform you of the whole procedures mapped out of the transfer of this money.We have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% for any expenses that might occur from both sides in the course of this transaction,while the remaining 70% will be for my son's investment, which you will assist him to do abroad.\\n\\nFurther information and arrangement will commence as soon as trust, confidence and good relationship will be established and safety of this fund assured when transferred to your account.Please treat this matter with utmost urgency.May Allah (God) bless you as I earnestly hope for your\\nassistance. \\n\\nBest Regards \\n\\nMonica Yangani (for the family)\\n\\n\\n\\n__________________________________________________________________\\nIntroducing the New Netscape Internet Service. \\nOnly $9.95 a month -- Sign up today at http://isp.netscape.com/register\\n\\nNetscape.

The company that\\nexecuted the contracts have been duly paid and the\\ncontracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$19.2\\nMillion lying unclaimed in the escrow account of the\\nCentral Bank of Nigeria.\\n\\nUpon interogation of the directors of engineering and\\nfinance, who both happens to be my contemporaries in\\nthe university, they confessed to me in confidence\\nthat they had an agreement with the original\\ncontractor to re-value the original contract by 30%.\\n\\n\\nThis 30% which amounts to USD19.2m was to be their share from the contract, since the original contractor was well disposed towards giving them the conventional 10% kickback. When I now asked them what they intended to do now that my committee has discovered this USD19.2M. They begged me not to disclose this information to the government as they will likely lose their jobs and their family names destroyed. \\n\\nI was at at a crossroad, as I did not want my friends to suffer for what other top government officials do and get away with. I discussed with the other two members of my committee and we all unanimously agreed to transfer this fund out and share amongst ourselves.\\n\\nI have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by\\nmy colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas\\npartner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$19.2M\\nlegally sub-contracting the entitlement to you/your\\ncompany. \\n\\nThis is bearing in mind that our  civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign company or running  foreign account while in government service hence the need for a foreign partner.\\n\\nShould this transaction interest you, you are to\\ncontact me on my personal e-mail address, so that I\\ncan brief you fully, and discuss your renumeration for\\nthis undertaking.\\n \\nAll logistics are in place and all modalities worked\\nout for the smooth conclusion of the transaction \\nwithin ten to fourteen days of commencement after\\nreceipt of the following information:  Your  full\\nname/ company name, address, company's details &\\nactivities, telephone & fax numbers.\\n\\nThese information will enable us make the applications\\nand lodge claims to the concerned ministries &\\nagencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent\\nto state here that this transaction is entirely  based\\non trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque\\ndrawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria\\ncorrespondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is\\ngoing to be made out in your name.\\n\\n\\nPlease acknowledge the receipt of this letter  using my personal E-mail address.\\n\\nYours Faithfully \\n\\nAbayomi Davies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I believe that you are capable and reliable in handling this urgent\\r\\ninternational transaction of this sort. I am VIVIAN KABA, the dougher of comrade TOMSIN KABA\\r\\nthe Zimbabwean former Minister for Youth & Gender Equality who is also a businessman and politician, in the Zimbabwean political arena. My father was the famous politician who stood firm against President\\r\\nMugabe 's idea of continuous seizure of White farms and the distribution of it to the blacks without compensation to the owners. Because of my father's stand in this issue, he was killed on the 14th April 2001 by a planned motor accident along Mashonaland in Western Mashona province of Zimbabwe, the planners of the accident are said\\r\\nto be dissidents soldiers suspected to have the backing of the government and President Mugabe. Sir, when this accident occurred at about 10:15 am Zimbabwean time my\\r\\nfather did not die on the spot rather he was rushed to Harare hospital by some members of the opposition group.\\r\\nSensing that if my father dies we shall be the next target, my mother in her sick condition managed under special arrangements by some UDM members (the opposition group) managed to sneak us out of Zimbabwe to DAKAR SENEGAL where we are to seek asylum. It was at this stage that my mother confided in me that my father, before he died, had released certain documents to her. One of these documents is the main reason iam writing this letter to you, and it concerns a deposit of one diplomatic box my father concealed with one of the private security company here in dakar containing US$15M (fifteen million, united states dollars) declared as family valuables, and other vital\\r\\ndocuments which was meant for his political campaign in the past election march 2002. We are now in DAKAR SENEGAL with the original documents of deposit intact, and because of the existing law, which prevents asylum seekers / refugee like us to operate an account that exceeds US$1000.00 and at the same time, there is no way we can comfortably transfer this money abroad for safe keeping and investment without assistance from someone overseas, I decided to write to you seek for your help for this money to be transferred into your private bank account\\r\\nas all arrangements for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care of. I want to a ssure you also that this transaction is 100% risk free as no other person knows this box apart from my younger borther and i as my\\r\\nmother .Sir, as for your reward kind assistance we have resolved to give you 20% of the total amount, 5% will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction. We planned to invest the rest of the money in your country under your guidance. If you are willing to help us, try as much as possible to reach me with the above number for more briefing, and also, to enable us proceed in earnest towards concluding the transfer. However you will be kind enough to give me\\r\\nyour private number, I will be glad to call you. Sir, bear in mind that our lives depend on this fund and we do hope\\r\\nthat this money will be safe when finally transferred into your account. I do hope to establish a rewardi ng and good relationship with you and your family after this transaction. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible. Thanks for your co-operation and God bless.

I am married to Mr.GREOGE  SANKOH  who worked with South African embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. \\n\\n \\n\\nHe died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 5.5Million U.S.(FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDERD thousand Dollars) in a trunk box in one ( Security And Finance Company) in cote d' ivoire.Presently, this money is still with the Security And Finance Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next two years due to cancer problem.\\n\\n \\n\\nThough what disturbs me most is my stroke Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. \\n\\n \\n\\nI want a church that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.\\n\\n \\n\\nI took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't !\\n want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. \\n\\n\\n\\nI don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. \\n\\n \\n\\nI don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.\\n\\n \\n\\nAs soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the BANK in ivory coast.\\n\\nI will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund.

(PSUD - News), an emerging provider of oilfield \\nservices to major and independent producers of oil and natural gas, \\nannounced today that the company has formed Algae BioFuels Inc. as a \\nwholly owned subsidiary. Algae BioFuels will be engaged in the research and \\ndevelopment of algae cultivation as an energy source in the production \\nof biodiesel, an economically feasible and eco-friendly alternative to \\npetroleum-based transportation fuels. The R&D and production facilities \\nfor Algae BioFuels will be based in Arizona and Australia.\\n\\n\"PetroSun\\'s formation of Algae BioFuels is a forward-looking strategy,\" \\nsaid L. Rayfield Wright, president of PetroSun. \"The 0pp0rtunity to \\nproduce a renewable energy product that will assist in providing a \\nhealthier planet for future generations cannot be ignored.\"\\n\\nBiofuel is any fuel that is derived from biomass -- which contains \\nrecently living organisms or their metabolic byproducts. Biofuel is a \\nrenewable energy source, unlike other natural resources such as petroleum, \\ncoal and nuclear fuels. Agricultural products specifically grown for use \\nas biofuels include corn and soybeans.\\n\\nExtensive research is currently being conducted to determine the \\nutilization of microalgae as an energy source, with applications being \\ndeveloped for biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, methane and even hydrogen. \\nIndependent studies have demonstrated that algae is capable of producing 30 \\ntimes more oil per acre than the current crops now utilized for the \\nproduction of biofuels. Algae biofuel contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and \\nhighly biodegradable.\\n\\nThe Office of Fuels Development, a division of the Department of \\nEnergy, funded a program from 1978 through 1996 under the National Renewable \\nEnergy Laboratory known as the \"Aquatic Species Program.\" The focus of \\nthis program was to investigate high-oil algae that could be grown \\nspecifically for the purpose of wide-scale biodiesel production. Some \\nspecies of algae are ideally suited to biodiesel production due to their \\nhigh oil content, in excess of 50%, and extremely rapid growth rates.\\n\\nOne of the biggest advantages of biodiesel, compared to many other \\nalternative transportation fuels, is that it can be used in existing diesel \\nengines, which relieves automotive manufacturers of having to make \\ncostly engine modifications. Biodiesel can also be mixed, at any ratio, \\nwith conventional petroleum diesel. As a result, the alternative fuel can \\nbe used in the current distribution infrastructure, replacing petroleum \\ndiesel either wholly, or as a diesel fuel blend with minimal \\nintegration costs.\\n\\nAbout PetroSun\\n\\nPetroSun\\'s current operations are concentrated in the Ark-La-Tex region \\nwith plans to expand into New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Australia in \\n2006. PetroSun provides a comprehensive array of products and services to \\nthe oil industry. The company\\'s cutting-edge technologies, combined \\nwith a proven ability to apply them effectively and safely within a \\ndisciplined ROI framework, creates long-term value for PetroSun shareholders \\nand partners. PetroSun is headquartered in Phoenix.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
